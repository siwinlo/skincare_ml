[{"id": 1, "title": "Infinity of Nations", "description": "National Museum of the American Indian in New York to Inaugurate a Permanent, Hemispheric Survey of Native American Art \r\n\r\nMedia Only\r\nJoshua A. Stevens\r\n(212) 514-3823\r\nstevensja@si.edu\r\n\r\nA spectacular, permanent exhibition of almost 700 works of Native art from throughout North, Central and South America is now open at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian in New York, the George Gustav Heye Center. Organized by geographic regions, \u201cInfinity of Nations: Art and History in the Collections of the National Museum of the American Indian\u201d demonstrates the breadth of the museum\u2019s renowned collection and highlights the historic importance of many of these iconic objects.\r\nFive years in the making, \u201cInfinity of Nations\u201d establishes the museum as an educational cornerstone for the city, providing an expansive overview of Native America. The exhibition is providing the foundation for eight seasons of public programs, each celebrating a different region and revealing the richness and diversity of indigenous nations.\r\n\r\nChosen to illustrate the geographic and chronological scope of the museum\u2019s collections, the objects have been meticulously conserved and are displayed in custom casework, some as large as 40 feet wide and 12 feet high, creating striking panoramas throughout the exhibition.\r\n\r\n\u201cInfinity of Nations\u201d opens with a display of headdresses, signifying the sovereignty of Native nations, including a magnificent Kayap\u00f3 krok-krok-ti, a macaw-and-heron-feather ceremonial headdress. Focal-point objects, representing each region, include an Aps\u00e1alooke (Crow) robe illustrated with warriors\u2019 exploits; a detailed Mayan limestone bas relief depicting a ball player; an elaborately beaded Inuit tuilli, or woman\u2019s inner parka, made for the mother of a newborn baby; a Mapuche kultrung, or hand drum, that depicts the cosmos; a carved and painted chief\u2019s headdress depicting a killer whale with a raven emerging from its back, created and worn by Willie Seaweed (Kwakwaka\u2019wakw); an anthropomorphic Shipibo joni chomo, or water vessel from Peru; a Chumash basket decorated with a Spanish-coin motif; an ancient mortar from Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, N.M.; a gourd carved with a detailed picture of the Battle of Arica by Mariano Flores Kananga (Quechua); and an early Anishinaabe man\u2019s outfit complete with headdress, leggings, shirt, sash and jewelry. The exhibition concludes with works by Native artists such as Allan Houser (Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache) and Rick Bartow (Mad River Wiyot). \r\n\r\n\u201cLong before European contact, Native America was interconnected and culturally active,\u201d said Kevin Gover (Pawnee/Comanche), director of the National Museum of the American Indian. \u201cThis exhibition will demonstrate how, throughout time, the visual arts were an important communication tool of this ongoing vitality.\u201d  \r\n\r\n\u201cVisitors will experience the diversity of Native America through some of the most historically significant and greatest artistic masterpieces of the collection,\u201d said John Haworth (Cherokee), director of the Heye Center. \u201cThis will be a new moment for us to inspire and serve New York City residents, tourists and school groups.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cInfinity of Nations\u201d was organized by C\u00e9cile R. Ganteaume, museum associate curator. A major publication, edited by Ganteaume, has been co-published with HarperCollins. The invaluable contributions of Native historians and numerous community members provided new perspectives and historical information for the exhibition and the book.\r\n\r\n\u201cInfinity of Nations\u201d has received leadership support from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the City of New York, with support from the Office of the Mayor and the New York City Council through the Department of Cultural Affairs. It has received federal support from the Latino Initiatives Pool, administered by the Smithsonian Latino Center and the Smithsonian School Programming Fund. Public support has also been provided by the New York State Council on the Arts.\r\n\r\nLeadership foundation support is provided by the Leon Levy Foundation and Henry Luce Foundation. Support is also provided by the Booth Ferris Foundation, an anonymous donation administered by the Carnegie Corp., Valerie and Jack Rowe and the Rowe Family Foundation, Barbara and James Block and the American Express Foundation. \r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian in New York, the George Gustav Heye Center, is located at One Bowling Green in New York City, across from Battery Park. The museum is free and open every day (except Dec. 25) from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Thursdays until 8 p.m. For information, call (212) 514-3700 or visit www.americanindian.si.edu.\r\n\r\n###", "artforumID": 119261, "showStart": "2010-10-23T04:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-10-23T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.003/id20957/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Muisca clay head, Colombia, A.D. 1200\u20131600.

In this exhibition, Pnini\u2014known predominantly for his films\u2014has constructed an interactive installation comprised of two main elements The Set and The Vinyl Album, where the audience becomes an active participant. \r\n\r\nThe installation presents like a theatre stage, one that comes to life only when the viewer interacts with it.  Pnini\u2019s use of theatrical motifs enables him to act as puppeteer placing gallery visitors where they can be mesmerized by the illusion created by the work, while still being fully aware of its deception. \r\n\r\nEntering the space, viewers engage with the set, comprised of 12 rows of shoulder-height partitions forming a series of maze-like corridors in the gallery. Advancing through the space, visitors begin to experience the installation. The partitions form a vast seascape rendered in blues and cutout wave shapes. The wave side of the installation is a tribute to sea travel\u2014and to the myriad of reasons travelers have made journeys for millennia. It is a voyage as a tale; one of fame, romance, escape, and the unknown promises of a new land. \r\n\r\nThe vinyl album is a limited edition pressing conceived of, and produced by Pnini, featuring musician Hannah Lee Thompson performing songs dating from the 1800s which relate to the themes of water and fire. A record player is waiting in the space for visitors to play the two songs\u2014Haul Away Joe, a sea shanty which tells the story of life-long adventure of a sea traveler, and The Two Orphans Waltz which references the Brooklyn Theatre fire on December 5, 1876 where 300 people were trampled to death trying to escape a fire that started during a performance. Both songs will also be performed live by Hannah Lee Thompson several times during the show.\r\n\r\nMiniature theaters\u2014creating a play within a play\u2014are seen throughout the installation. An antique wooden radio holds within it a miniature set of the Brooklyn Theatre at the moment the tragic fire broke out. An old liquor cabinet installed in the gallery has also been transformed into an empty theatre showing only the set where a story of sea travel will unfold.\r\n\r\nWhen visitors exit the space, the reverse side of the wave partitions form a landscape of fire. Rendered in rich yellows and oranges, the back of each wave cutout becomes a flame. \r\nAs visitors complete the journey from one side of the gallery to the other, they act as the absent protagonists of the two stories of the installation. With this double-feature of installation and performance\u2014fire and water, two stories, two songs\u2014activated by music and the participants, Two Figures in a Field becomes a story of the forgotten, met at the moment when the drama has ended and the curtain is just about to drop. \r\n\r\n\t\t**\r\n\r\nTom Pnini (b. 1981, Israel) creates time-based works and large-scale installations.

Like the startling images of Peter Moore, Robert Mapplethorpe, Peter Hujar, and Gordon Matta-Clark, the photographs of Alvin Baltrop memorialize New York City at a breaking-point moment amid ruin and chaos.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs such, they constitute an important document, remarkable both for its social import as well as for its groundbreaking visual dare. Rarely shown during his lifetime, Baltrop\u2019s images return us to that conflicted era when the city was on the brink of a financial crisis; they convey the raw energy that characterized some of the city\u2019s most impassioned grassroots campaigns for survival. Focusing on the derelict warehouses sited alongside Manhattan's West Side piers, Baltrop\u2019s images are an extensive documentation of the underground gay culture that flourished along the Hudson River, in an isolated section alongside the collapse of a segment of the West Side Elevated Highway in 1973. A few blocks southwest of Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District, the area also became a center for drug smuggling and prostitution. Baltrop\u2019s images captured leisurely sunbathing, cruising, sexual acts, and crime scenes. With a sensibility to architecture, Baltrop portrayed his subjects with a heightened sense of drama, instilling his scenes with humanity. While the interest in Baltrop\u2019s work often focuses on the libidinous atmosphere he captured, it\u2019s important to situate that moment as pivotal in the LGBTQ community in its struggle for inclusion and civil rights.\r\n\r\nThe Life and Times of Alvin Baltrop will feature over 120 photographs drawn from the Bronx Museum\u2019s permanent collection and from private collections. In addition, the artist\u2019s personal archive, housed at the Bronx Museum, will be shown to the public for the first time. In conjunction with the exhibition, the Bronx Museum will partner with Italian publisher Skira to produce a 200-page, richly illustrated catalog.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE ARTIST\r\nAlvin Jerome Baltrop was born December 11, 1948, to Dorothy Mae Baltrop shortly after she had moved from Virginia to the Bronx with her eldest son James. He began photographing with a twin-lens Yashica camera in his early teens. Baltrop joined the US Navy in 1969 and served in Vietnam, where he photographed fellow sailors doing chores or at leisure. He received an honorable discharge in 1972, and went on to attend New York City\u2019s School of Visual Arts from 1973 to 1975. It was during that period that Baltrop started documenting the gay communities in the West Village area and along the piers. Late during the 1990s, artist John Drury nominated Baltrop for a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award. Baltrop had few exhibitions in his lifetime, and his work only gained critical recognition after his death, particularly after art critic Douglas Crimp published an article about his work for Artforum in 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life and Times of Alvin Baltrop is presented in collaboration with The Alvin Baltrop Trust, managed by Third Streaming Advisory Services and Galerie Buchholz. It is presented in conjunction with the Stonewall 50 Consortium.", "artforumID": 168714, "showStart": "2019-09-07T04:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-19T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id04874/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Alvin Baltrop, Untitled (Portrait of Marsha P.

Beginning with her premiere catwalk show in 1991, Sui has shaped not only the garments, textiles, accessories, cosmetics, and interiors that comprise her design universe, but also the course of fashion history by popularizing the boutique fashion look. Sui\u2019s unique approach to creating narratives through her work is legendary: a self-taught historian of culture, art, and fashion, she samples music, books, exhibitions, movies, time periods, photography, and art movements in her designs.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Sui has explored wide-ranging materials and inspirations, including papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mannequin heads; linens by Vera; Claire McCardle sportswear; army surplus jackets; Japanese hankies; qipao dresses; wood-soled platforms from Goody Two-Shoes; the style of Jane Holzer, Zandra Rhodes, and Anita Pallenberg; and Minnie Mouse. Her collections are replete with references, processed and creatively reimagined through the filter of Anna Sui.\r\n\r\nUnlike other popular American designers, Sui is driven by telling stories head-to-toe about the worlds of cowgirls, grunge girls, hippie chicks, hula girls, Mods, pirate rock stars, Pre-Raphaelite maidens, and surfer nomads. The exhibition gives insights into her process, allowing the viewer to step inside her imagination and watch it unfold.\r\n\r\nThe World of Anna Sui features approximately one-hundred looks from the designer\u2019s archive, presenting a roll call of twelve archetypes that are staples of the Sui aesthetic. It also spotlights her heroes as a youth and the importance of her collaborators, including the New York City Garment Center.\r\n\r\nThe first iteration of this exhibition debuted at the Fashion and Textile Museum, London, in the summer of 2017.\r\n\r\nThe World of Anna Sui was curated by Dennis Nothdruft for the Fashion and Textile Museum, London.

Spanning a period of six decades, the exhibition is organized by independent curator and critic Karen Wilkin and will be accompanied by a full-color catalogue featuring essays by Wilkin and Mark di Suvero. A number of events will be presented during the exhibition including a performance by Passlof\u2019s sister, the well- known choreographer Aileen Passloff, and her dancers.\r\n\r\n\"Pat Passlof: The Brush Is the Finger of the Brain\" features selections from the artist\u2019s early abstract expressionist paintings, emerging from her time at Black Mountain College in the summer of 1948. While there, she studied with Willem de Kooning, who became her good friend and taught her privately. Her works of the '50s became looser and more gestural, a direction that intensified through the early '80s. Though the artist stated that narrative was a distraction and had no place in painting, in the mid-1980s Passlof began to incorporate figurative representations, often landscapes populated with images of centaurs, nymphs and horses. Allusions to the grid and geometry also emerged through repetition, patterns and marks in her large compositions. Passlof\u2019s varied works defy easy categorization, with a palette that ranged from dark colors and earth tones to soft pastel, but all are connected through her ability to capture the spontaneity and sensuousness of paint through her intuitive, physically vigorous, and eloquent brush marks.\r\n\r\nThe artist immersed herself equally in teaching, and Karen Wilkin writes in the catalogue: \u201cPasslof plainly followed the advice she gave to her students: \u2018\u2026push back the limits--be willing to risk or sacrifice what you have--throw the cards to the winds and see where they come down. Look for new and unexpected combinations.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPasslof\u2019s biography is a remarkable account of an ambitious artist\u2019s journey through the New York art world in the wake of World War II--the story of a determined, daring, and talented young woman in an era dominated by chest-beating male painters and sculptors,\u201d writes Wilkin. Born in Georgia in 1928, Passlof grew up in New York City where she became a significant painter of the New York School, part of the Ninth Street creative scene, and an originator and exhibitor at the artist-run March Gallery on Tenth Street in the late 50s. She moved to the uptown Green Street Gallery in 1961 run by Richard Bellamy, and was included in his seminal exhibition \u201cAbstract Painting 1960-1969\u201d at P.S.1, Long Island City, NY, in 1983, returning to MoMA with her work featured in \u201cMaking Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction\u201d in 2017. A complete chronology is here.\r\n\r\nPat Passlof was introduced to Milton Resnick by Willem de Kooning in 1948, while Resnick was dating de Kooning\u2019s future wife Elaine. Passlof and Resnick began living together in the mid-1950s and married in 1962. They remained involved in each other\u2019s lives on a daily basis and were each other\u2019s biggest supporters, though they chose to live and work in separate converted synagogues around the block from each other in the mid-70s. Passlof created the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation, which she planned in her final years.\r\n\r\nSupport for\u00a0\"Pat Passlof: The Brush Is the Finger of the Brain\" is provided by the Carl & Marilynn Thoma Art Foundation.

His creations mine the artifacts and reconfigured detritus of larger technological systems. Some already exist, while others are likely to exist in the near future: emotional robotics, computational engineering, behemoth venture-capital firms, and server farms.\r\n\r\nFuture Tense considers humanity's collective, unclear conclusion, portraying an apocalypse that never seems to arrive. We have birthed both technological miracles and existential threats: alongside the Green Revolution and the Information Age have come climate change and runaway inequality. Crispin\u2019s work embodies this paradox of technological advancement \u2013 which simultaneously enables both improvement and destruction.\r\n\r\nEncompassing a remarkable aesthetic and technical range, the exhibition co-opts the aesthetics of Silicon Valley: overwhelming infographics, branded identities, slick logos. Crispin undermines and explodes this visual language with a transhumanist mysticism drawn from global cultural reference points. The clock is ticking down. Metaphors of time and progress recur throughout: from 3D-printed candelabras to a wristwatch that only tells us not to panic. (Always relevant.) A series of modified fire hydrants and safety labels augur an unresolved future that is simultaneously utopian and dystopian: Boundless Joy, Endless Pain, Hungry Ghosts.\r\n\r\nFar from hopeless, these works are ecstatic. Or perhaps they\u2019re in a place beyond hope, inhabiting a state of only speed and collision as humanity either dies off or transcends itself. If we are to endure, we need more than just technology: our survival demands a new vocabulary, one towards which Crispin moves.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition is on view from January 25 through March 23, 2020. An opening reception will be held on Saturday, January 25 at 3pm.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSterling Crispin (b. 1985, Maui, Hawaii) lives and works in California. Unlike most artists grappling with similar subject matter, Crispin allows for reverence of technology itself: glimpses of uncanny beauty appear amongst each work\u2019s sinister composition. In Crispin's words: \"Technology is an extension of humanity, an embodiment of the human spirit, rather than an external force that we must mitigate. This distributed life-form, pulsing on the surface of the earth, has its own agency & agenda. I'm interested in creating new dialogues, signs, & symbols which challenge existing, contradictory narratives about the future & their consequences for the present.\"\r\n\r\nCrispin received his Master of Fine Arts & Master of Science in Multimedia Engineering from the University of California Santa Barbara. His work has been exhibited in museums & galleries worldwide & has been published in Frieze, Wired, BOMB, Rhizome, Creators Project, Fast Company, Der Spiegel, Der Blaue Reiter, Y-Combinator's Hacker News, & the Post Internet Survival Guide.

They thrust you towards the edge of a precipice right where your inhibitions end and your subconscious begins. Suddenly, you find yourself in the entrails of a complex labyrinth where the walls are moving, reconfiguring the very space you\u2019re walking through. Each painting is a clue in a grander narrative arc, but there is neither a linear sequence to the story, nor is there a plot. Only a feeling of uprootedness. Are you looking inside someone else\u2019s mind or your own? \r\n\r\nThe scene is set in the moments preceding your awaking. You are knee-deep in a lucid dream. Your subconscious is soliloquizing.

Debuting new paintings and frescoes, both shows will present boldly expressive, large-scale works that comprise a meditation upon the restless physical and spiritual journey that has shaped the course of the artist\u2019s acclaimed four-decade career. Francesco Clemente: India will be on view at Vito Schnabel Projects, New York, from November 8, 2019 through February 15, 2020. Francesco Clemente: Clouds will be on view at Vito Schnabel Gallery, St. Moritz, from December 18, 2019 through February 2, 2020.\r\n\r\nThe exhibitions will highlight Clemente\u2019s famed nomadism, which embraces divergent geographies and cultural climates, bridging East and West. The scope and power of the artist\u2019s oeuvre are felt through his distinctive sense of color and his deeply personal visual lexicon, a figural language that subsumes eclectic narratives, rituals, ideas, and symbols inspired by his global wandering. Clemente\u2019s work traverses time and recorded history to probe the mysteries, ecstasies, incongruities, and, ultimately, the gravitas of the human condition. In his quest to explore the metaphysics of spirituality, mysticism, identity, and the self, Clemente has created a body of work in a variety of mediums that is often charged with eroticism and intimacy, rich in references, and expansive in its openness to interpretation.\r\n\r\nOpening at Vito Schnabel Projects in New York, the exhibition Francesco Clemente: India takes its name from the title of a new series of monumental canvases that continue Clemente\u2019s lifelong dialogue with the cultural and artistic practices of India, where he maintains a home. The four paintings on view depict maps of the country\u2019s geographic borders punctured with symbols that draw from the itinerant experiences of Clemente\u2019s life, and from his passion for paradox and metamorphosis. Painted in a sensual palette of understated earthen hues, these compositions are accented with brushstrokes of brazen pink.\r\n\r\nIn one painting, India is composed of a field of pink flowers whose petals are tinged with subtle hints of blue. A background comprised of white skulls \u2013 a motif Clemente returns to time and again \u2013 surround the outline of the nation, streaked with drips of paint. In another work, the map of India is covered by waves and inhabited by fish, while the Indian Ocean has turned into land. The third canvas depicts the nation as an apparition in the sky; mysterious pink clouds part to form the shape of the country through which the sun\u2019s energy radiates a hypnotic white light. Finally, the fourth painting in the group is engulfed by a smoggy atmospheric haze. Here, a haunting female figure dressed in a traditional sari and rendered with hollow white eyes, inhabits and animates India\u2019s distinctive shape.\r\n\r\nImages of clouds are likewise central to the exhibition that will open at Vito Schnabel Gallery in St. Moritz, introducing the new series Clouds (2018) and Aspects of the Moon (2019). These paintings and frescoes reference mystical and celestial themes, and allude to histories in the tradition of painting itself.\r\n\r\nExecuted in oil on canvas, the paintings of Francesco Clemente: Clouds interrogate the value of an image and the laden symbolism of this trans-historical motif. With a lineage dating back to Medieval and Renaissance painting, clouds manifested a devotional, spiritual presence evoking the miraculous and the divine. Challenging the limitations and possibilities of this artistic inheritance, Clemente\u2019s paintings here foster an exchange between sensuality and spirituality, eroticism and ecstasy. In soft washes of color and dynamic strokes of the brush, these depictions of large cumulus clouds take on the bodily quality of embracing couples with their limbs entwined and morphing into a new whole.\r\n\r\nClemente has also cited as a reference for this series the thirteenth century author Sung Po-jen\u2019s Guide to Capturing a Plum Blossom, a reflection on artistic perception. In his preface, Po-jen wrote: \u201cI am so addicted to plum blossoms that I laid out my garden around them and built a pavilion to view them and published a collection of poems called The Pure and Fragile in praise of them. And still I failed to exhaust their subtlety, much like my ancestor Sung Ching, who turned to writing about clouds when plum blossoms proved too elusive.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlso on view in St. Moritz will be six frescoes from the series Aspects of the Moon (2019), created during the artist\u2019s recent sojourn to Rome. Here, the artist returns to a classical medium and technique, one that is especially familiar to Clemente and deeply rooted in the history and heritage of his native Naples. Clemente has been working with frescoes since 1979, and was the first contemporary European painter to resurrect the tradition. His simple, expressive imagery is charged, intimate, sensual, and at times borders on the grotesque. The fragmented narratives he creates feel allegorical or mythological, with dreamlike visions of the human form as the expression of both inner psychic realms and palettes for the effects of the exterior world.\r\n\r\nClemente populates these frescoes with figures drawn in raw umber and green earth. One climbs up a ladder to reach the moon; it dangles from a thread that has dropped from a chimney within the silhouetted architecture of a house. Against a saffron yellow ground, another figure holds its own disembodied head. Three pairs of arms reach out to caresses the body, while a crescent moon hovers above. In another painting, three figures embrace while one reaches his arm overhead, holding a pair of scissors to snip a string suspending a radiating blue egg. Clemente\u2019s palette here is rich and lush. He mixes darker pigments with vibrant and translucent hues to create a luminous energy and glow. Some frescos employ an aquamarine or deep celestial blue that is reminiscent of the iridescent pigment known as ultramarine, developed from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone and used widely throughout the Renaissance in \u201csecco\u201d fresco painting.\r\n\r\nNon-linear and expansive, the works on view in these exhibitions find Clemente drawing inspiration from cultural, historical, and aesthetic affinities, but continually reinvigorating his art with a pictorial weight that resolutely confirms his commitment to the here and now.\r\n\r\nAbout the Artist\r\nFrancesco Clemente was born in 1952 in Naples, Italy. He studied architecture at the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma, La Sapienza in Rome in 1970, before turning his focus instead to art.\r\n\r\nClemente came to prominence in the late 1970s and cemented an international reputation with his participation in the 39th edition of Venice Biennale in 1980. He is most closely associated with the Transavanguardia movement in Italy and recognized as an influential figure of Neo-Expressionism in the United States. Clemente\u2019s generation came of age amidst the politicization of Italy, where conceptual artistic strategies and the dogmatism of Arte Povera prevailed. Against this background of conflict, Clemente chose to concentrate on painting as a model of inner reconciliation and went on to explore a contemplative and symbolic mode of painting that revolved around images of the body as the boundary between inner and outer self.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist activities in Rome, social and cultural upheaval, and the dogmas of consumerism that plagued Western Europe, Clemente fiercely sought alternative narratives and images of contemporaneity, and found creative refuge in the philosophical, spiritual, and aesthetic ideologies of the East. Clemente travelled to India for the first time in 1971 and later visited Afghanistan with his friend and mentor Alighiero e Boetti. Before settling and establishing his studio in New York in 1980, Clemente lived on and off for ten years in India, where he studied Sanskirt as well as Hindu and Buddhist literature, educating himself in the library of the Theosophical Society in Chennai (formerly Madras). There he absorbed the culture, craftsmanship, and folk art traditions, while learning first-hand from Indian miniaturists and sign painters who were making billboard advertisements for Bollywood films.\r\n\r\nIn New York, Clemente continued to collaborate with creative lights across disciplines, painting with such artists as Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and illuminating manuscripts with writers Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, John Wieners, Rene Ricard, Vincent Katz, and Salman Rushdie. With Raymond Foye, Clemente published The Hanuman Books.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Clemente was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Clemente\u2019s work has been presented at numerous international institutions, including Nationalgalerie, Berlin; Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst, Basel; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Royal Academy of Arts, London; Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Galleria d\u2019Arte Moderna, Bologna; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Guggenheim Museum Bilbao; Sezon Museum of Art, Tokyo; Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli; and Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence.\r\n\r\nHis work is featured in many prominent museum collections worldwide, including the Art Institute of Chicago; Miami Art Museum; Kunstmuseum Basel; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao and New York; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\r\n\r\nClemente lives and works in New York, Rome, Chennai (formerly Madras), and Varanasi, India.\r\n\r\nFor additional information, please contact:\r\n\r\nAndrea Schwan, Andrea Schwan Inc., info@andreaschwan.com, +1 917 371 5023", "artforumID": 178849, "showStart": "2019-11-08T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id15009/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Vito Schnabel Projects | New York", "galleryDescription": "Vito Schnabel Projects was founded in New York in 2006, and Vito Schnabel Gallery was founded in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in 2015.", "address": "43 Clarkson Street,1A", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10014", "lng": -74.00801995, "lat": 40.729791463674, "hours": "Mon - Sat 10am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "vitoschnabel.com", "galleryEmail": "info@vitoschnabel.com", "phone": "+16463862246", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.777Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.777Z"}, {"id": 43, "title": "El asesinato cambia el mundo /Assassination changes the world", "description": null, "artforumID": 179552, "showStart": "2020-01-10T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-29T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id15712/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Teresa Margolles, &#8220;Super Speed / El Paso, Texas,&#8221; 2020", "gallery": "James Cohan | Tribeca", "galleryDescription": "James Cohan specializes in modern and contemporary art.

Inspired by a wide range of subjects\u2014from film and television, to theatrical sets, to found imagery\u2014Hoshine\u2019s painting practice is grounded in the experiences of his daily life. Expressed in abstract forms and gestures, however, these everyday references are imbued with newfound emotion and narrative quality. For his upcoming exhibition at Hollis Taggart, Hoshine will present a selection of new paintings on wood panel that capture his converging fascinations with theater, poster design, and the occult. \r\n\r\nKenichi Hoshine: The Magician and The Thief will be on view through February 15, 2020 at the gallery\u2019s flagship location at 521 W. 26th Street. The show will be accompanied by a catalogue that includes an essay by art historian and critic John Yau that examines Hoshine\u2019s vision and formal approach. An opening reception will be held on January 9, from 6:00 to 8:00 PM. \r\n\r\nHoshine\u2019s paintings are compellingly elusive. Representational elements emerge within his bold, vividly colored compositions only to disappear into emotive tangles of brushstrokes, denying the viewer any narrative clarity. For Hoshine, the depth and openness of the visual experience are essential, saying, \u201cI have always found images that are obscured or fragmented to be more interesting than \u2018complete\u2019 pictures.\u201d In his early work, this fragmentation was driven by the use of an extensive cadre of materials. His paintings often incorporated acrylics, charcoal, tea, beeswax, and oils, giving his abstractions both aesthetic and physical depth. \r\n\r\nWith his most recent works, Hoshine has substantively pared down his materials, focusing predominantly on the qualities and possibilities of acrylic paint alone. Leveraging the speed with which the material dries, Hoshine actively layers and then scrapes away the paint on the panel surface\u2014often numerous times in a single work. This results in a physical and active editing process that has become critical to his career-long exploration of notions of revelation and obscurity. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the purposeful limitation of materials has infused a fresh spontaneity into Hoshine\u2019s approach, yielding a wider range of gestural actions and effects. Together, his meticulous, at times obsessive, process and rich use of color result in paintings that draw the eye and inspire deep looking. With his upcoming exhibition, Hoshine continues his study of the relationships between representation and abstraction, nature and artifice, and the psychological experience of indoor and outdoor environments. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I first came across Kenichi\u2019s work, I was immediately captivated by the vibrancy and intricacy of his compositions. I\u2019ve been examining the development of his process and approach since that initial introduction and continue to be moved by his vision and the energy that his work exudes. I\u2019m delighted to have the opportunity to share his work with our audiences and to support the development of a catalogue that shines a light on his practice,\u201d said Hollis Taggart. \r\n\r\n\u2014\r\n\r\nBorn in Tokyo, Japan in 1977, Hoshine grew up in New Jersey and studied in New York, where he attended the School of Visual Arts. Hoshine\u2019s work has been exhibited widely in the U.S. and abroad. In 2016, his paintings were exhibited as part of the Colecci\u00f3n Solo at the Espacio Solo Gallery in Madrid, as well as the two-person exhibition Untouchable: D\u00e9rive de l\u2019espirit at the Galerie Guido Romero in Paris. Most recently, his work has been presented in a group show at the Harpy Gallery in New Jersey; in collaboration with Pt. 2 Gallery at the Juxtapoz Clubhouse in Miami; and in the solo exhibition Amawalk in California. In addition to his studio practice, Hoshine has taught at the Pratt Institute in New York. \r\n\r\nAbout Hollis Taggart\r\nFounded in 1979, Hollis Taggart presents significant works of American art, showcasing the trajectory of American art movements from the Hudson River School to American Modernism and the Post-War and Contemporary eras. Its program is characterized by a deep commitment to scholarship and bringing to the fore the work of under-recognized artists. The gallery has sponsored several catalogue raisonn\u00e9 projects, most recently for the American Surrealist artist Kay Sage, and has been instrumental in advancing knowledge of such compelling artists as Alfred Maurer, Arthur B. Carles, and more recently, Theodoros Stamos, Marjorie Strider and Michael (Corinne) West. In the summer of 2019, the gallery announced the formal expansion of its primary market business and focus on the presentation of contemporary work, operating under Hollis Taggart Contemporary. The gallery\u2019s flagship space is located on W. 26th Street and its contemporary division is based at secondary location on W. 25th Street. The gallery also has a private viewing and storage facility in the neighborhood. With 40 years of experience, Hollis Taggart is widely recognized by collectors and curators for its leadership, expertise, and openness, on matters of art history, and market trends and opportunities.\r\n \r\n###\r\n \r\nFor more information, please contact:\r\nAlina Sumajin\r\nPAVE Communications & Consulting\r\nalina@paveconsult.com / 646-369-2050", "artforumID": 180401, "showStart": "2020-01-09T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16561/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Kenichi Hoshine (b. 1977) Wurlitzer, 2019 Acrylic on wood 48 x 60 inches (HTG15962)", "gallery": "Hollis Taggart", "galleryDescription": "Specialist in Abstract Expressionist, Pop, and American Post-War art with an expanding contemporary stable.

Having worked with the artist for over twenty years on a number of high-profile exhibitions and projects including the 2019 iteration of Asia Week New York, SEIZAN Gallery is thrilled to be showcasing Iwasaki in her first New York solo exhibition. Tiny Night, Tiny Light will bring together a selection of Eri Iwasaki\u2019s iconic female portraits from the past ten years and explore the artist\u2019s rise to the forefront of the contemporary Nihonga movement. \r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from traditional Japanese painting techniques as well as Buddhist art and contemporary manga, Iwasaki\u2019s portraits are a poetic exploration of her subject\u2019s innermost thoughts and dreams. After beginning her career in Nihonga, traditional Japanese painting, at the age of seventeen, Iwasaki began to experiment with the materials and subject matter of the genre. She quickly became known for her unique technique of enrobing her figures in unending swirls of platinum paint, as seen in her large-scale paintings Cotton Candy and A Princess Never Sleeps, where Iwasaki\u2019s delicate lines float around her subjects like escaping thoughts that cannot be contained. \r\n\r\nTwo of Iwasaki\u2019s most recent portraits, her gold-embossed Tiny Light, Tiny Night and Distant Light, the World Begins, both from 2019, are the highlights of the exhibition and explore the long influence of Buddhist art on Iwasaki\u2019s practice. The pair of paintings feature the image of a young child, the daughter of one of the artist\u2019s friends who has long acted as her muse. Iwasaki depicts the girl facing forward and then to the side, resplendent on a golden background and with a serene expression on her face. The image is reminiscent of ancient Japanese paintings of Amida Buddha, brought to life by Iwasaki for the 21st century. \r\n\r\nEri Iwasaki (b. 1968)\r\nEri Iwasaki circumvents the boundaries of Nihonga, the traditional Japanese painting style, with her expressive portraits of young children and women. While experimenting with the prescribed materials of Nihonga such as mineral pigments and silver and gold leaf, Iwasaki draws on her favorite childhood manga characters and Buddhist sculpture to move freely beyond the genre. With swirling lines of platinum paint on paper-thin sheets of gold leaf, she pulls the hidden emotions from her subjects to create forms that convey both gentleness and solemnity. Throughout her practice, Iwasaki seeks to explore the physical and emotional barriers that we wrap around ourselves when we feel vulnerable to the world, and in turn how we can learn to dissolve the hardened shells we create. \r\n\r\nEri Iwasaki will be present at the opening reception on Thursday, January 9, from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. Prior to the opening reception, SEIZAN Gallery will be holding a live painting session with Iwasaki from 4:00 to 6:00 pm where the artist will be demonstrating contemporary Nihonga painting methods. \r\n\r\nThe catalog for the exhibition with an accompanying essay by Daria Melnikova, Postdoctoral Scholar at Columbia University, will be available at the gallery.", "artforumID": 180310, "showStart": "2020-01-09T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16470/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Eri Iwasaki, Distant Light, The World Begins, 2019.

On view January 23 through February 29, 2020, this is Halvorson\u2019s fifth solo show at the gallery. On The Ground, also the title of her essay in Art In America (June/July 2018), continues Halvorson\u2019s exploration of the ground\u2014as a motif, material, and metaphor. Each painting registers an area of ground through Halvorson\u2019s close observation and pictorial description, while its accompanying surround incorporates crushed rocks and debris from the site of the painting\u2019s making. Together, they realize a faithful translation of place and time. The work in this exhibition was made in the Berkshire mountains, the Mojave Desert, and Matanzas, Cuba.\r\n\r\nThese hybrid paintings are made with gouache, site material, dry pigment, and printmaking. They expand Halvorson\u2019s on-site practice of transcribing direct experience by hand. While her previous work in oil allowed her encounter with an object to congeal over the course of a day, Halvorson has turned to gouache, a fast drying and graphic medium, which, like handwriting, records her observations in real time. Her paint application is indelible and fresco-like, transferring color from the brush into the absorbent ground of the panel.\r\n\r\nTouching down at various points of interest\u2014a piece of plastic, a blade of grass\u2014Halvorson\u2019s notational marks establish a correspondence between environment, painting, and viewer. Like a map, they depict the literal scape of the ground while offering an escape from mimesis. The reality of proximity breaks down as one gets lost in the archeology of a single stride. Gravel becomes galactic. The surround acts as a legend or key, a space for evidence and tools of calibration. A ruler, coins, or color chart orient the onlooker in terms of scale and perception, and the site material indexes the painting to its original locale. These are paintings of verification and memorialization. They ask how we make sense of what we see, how we express that witnessing, and how an account of experience is made concrete.\r\n\r\nHalvorson holds a BFA from The Cooper Union (2003) and an MFA from Columbia University (2007). She is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship to Vienna (2003-4), a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant (2009), and was a fellow at the French Academy in Rome (2014-15). During Fall 2019, her work was on view at The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston as part of The James and Audrey Foster Prize Exhibition, curated by Ruth Erickson.

Jacklighting refers to the nocturnal hunting practice of shining bright lights into a dark field in order to momentarily blind and stun animals. As if operating with a similar unnatural lighting system, the artist records transitory and ambiguous spaces through the lenses of her camera. In three video projects, Finel captures urban, rural, and underground landscapes that resist clarity and intelligibility. She experiments with architectural broad shots, close-ups, and microscopic scale. Installed at different angles, heights and on various surfaces, the works on display at The Chimney explore the malleability of pixels, the abstraction and limits of perceived images. The installation is accompanied by a sound piece by electro musician and artist Luc Kheradmand, Finel\u2019s longtime collaborator. Amplifying the vibration of the images, the soundtrack borrows from machinery and synthetic noises to accentuate the viewer\u2019s physical immersion. \r\nIn Jardins (Gardens) 2017, Finel descends into the subway to film an underground tropical greenhouse installed next to the platform. Behind the glass wall, with reflections of the trains roaring by, exotic plants stir in and out of darkness to briefly morph into glowing foliage. The stillness of Chinese fan palm trees and faux split leaf philodendrons is disturbed by flashing lights, turning their leaves a luminous green. Bromeliad plants suspiciously radiate in contrast to faded and greyish blooms in an aggregation of pulsing pink bracts and fluorescent bursts of red and yellow Flaming Sword. Lighting devices are gradually revealed, hidden on the ground or exposed as artificial suns. Human presence is signified by fast moving shadows on the glasshouse walls, culminating in a stroboscopic effect. Isolated and deprived of natural light and wind, the man-made jungle is a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne; a diorama staged to alleviate the anxiety of daily commuters. In one shot, the plants\u2019 silhouettes are confined to a 2D flatness. Behind the screens, they become Art Nouveau motifs, a wallpaper of endangered and powerless species.\r\n\r\nIn Triste Champignonniste (Sad Mushroom Farmer) 2017, Finel films a mushroom farm located in a former underground gypsum quarry. The videos are presented as a slideshow in a diptych format. In one series, doughy and stringy black and white surfaces alternate with bursting shapes that evoke foggy landscapes, smoky clouds and putrefaction. What resembles mushroom clouds in stop motion simultaneously recalls the archival Navy footage of underwater nuclear bomb tests in Bruce Conner\u2019s film, Crossroads. The second video features unidentifiable geometrical masses, reminiscent of desert landscape and cracked earth. The colors of these cool white mounds gradually verge towards a dull yellow. Rather than being confronted with identifiable growing crops, viewers might be witnessing a micro-cellular activity. A disease has spread throughout the farm rendering it no longer arable. The digital noise generated by Low-Light filming strangely activates and belies the stillness of the image. Actual rotting and decaying elements become intertwined with the deteriorating pixels in a metaphorical decomposition of the image. \r\n\r\nIn her most recent work, Hors-sol (Hydroponics) 2019, Finel has filmed a tomato greenhouse. The intensive crop cultivation is made possible by artificial heat, LED, and sodium lights, resulting in a pink, purple and yellow fake Aurora borealis. Architecture is given a predominant place this time. Some frames reference the romantic sublime as in Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s atmospheric landscape paintings. Others capture corrugated plastic, chimneys issuing black smoke, and an industrial metal structure covered by translucent pyramids, allowing the lights to pass through. Under a citrus-colored sky, disoriented birds circle above the production plant and cows lie on the ground in a nearby field. The fuchsia bathed electric expanse recalls dystopian science fiction movies as well as Dan Flavin\u2019s florescent light tube installations.\r\n\r\nIn her videos, Finel slows down to the rhythm of her subjects and allows time to pass through the landscapes. The works do not force narratives nor do they attempt to present a nature isolated from man. No artificial lights are needed to reveal the traces left by our species. Jacklighting is a permanent state: the natural world is preyed upon at all times, intentionally or through the unintended ramifications of human-led actions. A brave observer our times, Finel tracks and contemplates without blinders the sites we inhabit, shape and destroy and reveals them to us anew in all their contemporaneity.", "artforumID": 180405, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-23T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16565/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Hors-Sol, 2019", "gallery": "The Chimney", "galleryDescription": "The Chimney NYC is an exhibition and performance venue promoting multidisciplinary and international artists.", "address": "200 Morgan Avenue", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 11237", "lng": -73.933404354666, "lat": 40.71105763112, "hours": "Sat - Sun 2pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "thechimneynyc.com", "galleryEmail": "contact@TheChimneyNYC.com", "phone": null, "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.795Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.795Z"}, {"id": 76, "title": "Double Pleasure", "description": null, "artforumID": 180418, "showStart": "2020-01-23T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-14T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16578/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Alejandro Diaz, Untitled, 2019, Acrylic, 14 karat gold paint and found objects on canvas, 40 x 30 x 4\u201d", "gallery": "Ruiz-Healy Art | New York", "galleryDescription": "Ruiz-Healy Art represents Latin American, Latinx, and Texas-based mid-career and established artists.", "address": "74 East 79th Street\n2D", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10075", "lng": -73.9611236, "lat": 40.775645213696, "hours": "Tue - Sat 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "ruizhealyart.com", "galleryEmail": "patti@ruizhealyart.com", "phone": "+12125107873", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.796Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.796Z"}, {"id": 81, "title": null, "description": null, "artforumID": 180487, "showStart": "2020-01-23T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16647/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Takuji Hamanaka, Crizzled Light, 2019", "gallery": "Kristen Lorello", "galleryDescription": "Lower east side contemporary art gallery", "address": "195 Chrystie Street\nLobby", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10002", "lng": -73.9921662, "lat": 40.72209211367, "hours": "Tue - Sat 12pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "kristenlorello.com", "galleryEmail": "info@kristenlorello.com", "phone": "6465047892", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.796Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.796Z"}, {"id": 86, "title": null, "description": null, "artforumID": 180566, "showStart": "2020-01-08T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-23T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16726/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Karma | New York", "galleryDescription": "Karma is a contemporary art gallery located in the East Village, New York.", "address": "188 East 2nd Street, 172 East 2nd Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10009", "lng": -73.984049, "lat": 40.72253301367, "hours": "Tue - Sun 10am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "karmakarma.org", "galleryEmail": "info@karmakarma.org", "phone": "+12123908290", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.797Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.797Z"}, {"id": 135, "title": "Democracy Portraits", "description": null, "artforumID": 181044, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-23T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17204/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "ASHES/ASHES", "galleryDescription": "ASHES/ASHES specializes in contemporary art.

Frangella earned a master's degree in architecture at the University of Buenos Aires in 1972 before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. In 1976, he moved to New York City where he originally settled on Elk Street near Manhattan\u2019s City Hall.  Nearby he painted massive \u201cstreet\u201d murals on construction site walls, abandoned Hudson River piers and on impromptu stagesets in the nightclubs of the East Village and Tribeca: Pyramid Club, Mudd Club and the Limbo Lounge.  As a gay artist whose work was unapologetically queer, Frangella was a seminal figure in the subversive East Village art scene that developed in the early 1980s. Frangella\u2019s rich educational background gave him a sense of self-assurance and confidence that he generously shared with other artists in his circle, among them David Wojnarowicz.  Cynthia Carr, who authored a biography of Wojnarowicz, observed that Luis Frangella taught David how to paint.  The two artists frequently collaborated on drawings, paintings and other works, along with artists like Kiki Smith and Mike Bidlo.  Frangella, Bidlo and Wojnarowicz were instrumental in \u2018discovering\u2019 the iconic Pier 34, an abandoned Hudson River shipping terminal that quickly became an ad hoc \u2018artists museum\u2019 with a growing cast of participants who used unconventional mediums to transform its floors and walls. Known for constantly sketching and working on his pieces, Frangella's passion for art was perpetually vibrant and frequently inspired those around him. Equally at ease with painting and sculpture, Luis Frangella alternated between refined delicacy and robust muscularity. Frangella\u2019s initial September 1983 exhibition at Hal Bromm featured fourteen-foot tall figures painted directly on the gallery walls, forming a direct connection to Frangella\u2019s work at Pier 34 on the Hudson River.

The resulting bodily injuries were minor; they were dismissed from the hospital with only small cuts and bruises, yet the psychological impact of the incident proved to be far greater. \r\n\r\nThe incident is classified as a hate crime. The couple was intentionally struck with the driver speeding off after the incident. Wolf recalls the driver making eye contact with him prior to the hit then laughing after the impact was made. To this date, there has been no legal remedy or resolution with the perpetrator having never been found. The memory of this night is the source of Tensions, and the resulting body of work, through its exploration of materials and their juxtaposition, examines the layered interpretation of the crime. \r\n \r\nThe show\u2019s title takes its name from two, four-liter diffusers that rest on newly painted lavender floors, and disperse rose and tobacco oil throughout the gallery. Masculine and feminine aromas weave between the works and visitors, creating a dense atmosphere. The slippage between feminine and masculine, interior and exterior, the difference between the leather seats of a car and the hard surface of its metal facades, become a crucial thread throughout Tensions.\r\n \r\nWith May the Memory of that night Haunt You, Leather Interior (no 1) and (no 2), Wolf has draped white leather scraps dyed with cherries, red roses, and Shea oil, over steel fixtures. The leather interior references the physical interior of the driver's car and the driver's own interiority, hardened and rough. \r\n \r\nIn Fear of Softness (no 1) and (no 2), modified menswear paired with automotive parts, Wolf begins to approach an ideological space where softness and masculinity are not mutually exclusive. This sculptural pair is indicative of Wolf's longstanding interest in complicating our associations with menswear through materials that evoke flamboyancy and fragility. \r\n \r\nThe car itself is an object of fixation and a site of inquiry for Wolf as he dissects and reimagines its parts. Wolf's Connected is made up of Toyota Sienna sliding door part, lilies, and black rubber tubing. Unclean is a pair of mangled Toyota Sienna fender liners fixed with rabbit fur, a material with many associations. Rabbit fur also appears in Hidden Desires, folded over a steel pole protruding from the gallery wall. For Wolf, the rabbit fur is part of a queer vernacular representing fully realized sexual desires while simultaneously reflecting a dangerous and pervasive sentiment that gay men are unclean.\r\n \r\nThese manifestations of masculinity, and the corresponding relationship to queer bodies and femme energies, have always perplexed and captivated Wolf. Referencing a specific event, Tensions continues to tease out these nuanced relationships and their impact on the supposedly safe interiority of the Self as a queer black man.\r\n\r\n-Jesse Firestone", "artforumID": 178367, "showStart": "2020-01-10T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-23T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id14527/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Detail of Fear of Softness No. 2", "gallery": "Jack Barrett", "galleryDescription": "Jack Barrett specializes in contemporary art.

This is the first time the three works have been shown together, and the first significant exhibition of Indiana\u2019s sculpture since 2018\u2019s Robert Indiana: A Sculpture Retrospective at Albright-Knox, Buffalo, NY. An additional work will accompany the rooftop exhibition in High Line Nine, Gallery 3.\r\n\r\nEach of the three works is an iteration of Indiana\u2019s iconic LOVE series, articulated in three languages: English, Spanish, and Hebrew, or LOVE, AMOR, and AHAVA. The works represent three of New York\u2019s most historic and influential dialects, celebrating immigration and lingual diversity in one of the most visited public art spaces in the city. Indiana\u2019s archetypal stacked LOVE composition, with its bold serif lettering of VE stacked beneath the L and off-kilter O, is one of the most ubiquitous works of art of the 20th century. Belonging to a series of iconic paintings, sculptures, and prints dedicated to the theme of love that the artist commenced in the mid-1960s, the work is both accessible and complex in meaning. Layered with personal references, erotic metaphors, religious underpinnings, and socio-political commentary\u2014particularly as a symbol of 1960s idealism\u2014Indiana\u2019s use of the word love goes beyond the confines of cultures and language.\r\n\r\nAHAVA is realized in cor-ten steel, THE AMERICAN LOVE is colored blue, red, and white, and AMOR a striking red and yellow. The works all have significant provenance: an iteration of AHAVA is on permanent display at the Israel Museum in Tel Aviv, Israel, as a memorial tribute to Bishop James A. Pike; AMOR has stood in the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C.; and LOVE has been installed in several major cities across North America, Europe, Asia.\r\n\r\nOn view concurrently in the gallery\u2019s High Line Nine space (507 West 27th Street) is Electric American Love, White Blue Red, 2000. The work was first conceived in 1966, crystallizing many of Indiana's recurring themes. The artist's life-long fascination with American identity and symbolism is evoked by the color format, coupled with a playful sequence of lights that recall city diner signs and blinking traffic\u2014features of the urban landscape that Indiana drew upon throughout his career.\r\n\r\nThe publicly-sited Kasmin Sculpture Garden continues the gallery\u2019s long-standing dedication to the medium. Since October 2018, the exhibition program has put on view monumental works by Max Ernst and Joel Shapiro.\r\n\r\nFor sales inquiries, please contact:\r\nKasmin | + 1 212 563 4474 | info@kasmingallery.com\r\n\r\nFor press inquiries, please contact:\r\nKasmin | Molly Taylor | molly@kasmingallery.com\r\nResnicow & Associates | Sarah Morris | smorris@resnicow.com\r\nResnicow & Associates | Jill Mediatore | jmediatore@resnicow.com", "artforumID": 179594, "showStart": "2019-05-03T04:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-05-03T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id15754/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Installation view of Robert Indiana, in the Kasmin Sculpture Garden, 2019. \u00a9 2019 Morgan Art Foundation / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.

The artist layers impastoed oil paint, river rocks, wire, wood, and rope to build up each surface, creating topographical pictorial fields. In many works, bold colors, patterns, and abstracted organic forms bleed off the surface onto the handmade frames, unique appendages of wood, rope, and molded concrete.\r\n\r\nRodriguez\u2019s paintings employ techniques of abstraction to mine the autobiographical. While narratively ambiguous, each work attains a talismanic quality made evident by the artist\u2019s physical hand and its essential object-ness. Continuing to incorporate found materials in each painting, the artist packs his works with the color and detritus of life.\r\n\r\nSemper Virens\u2014Latin for \u201calways flourishing\u201d\u2014outlines a guiding philosophy for Rodriguez as an artist and a father witnessing the world. Moving organically from recent preoccupations with the symbolism of snakes and the sun, Rodriguez has crystalized these forms in the spiral, a central motif throughout the exhibition. As emblems of regeneration and regrowth, of new life borne out of devastation, spirals serve as elemental maps for developing a way forward under dire circumstances.\r\n\r\nDaniel Rios Rodriguez (b. 1978, Killeen, Texas) received his MFA from Yale in 2007 and was a 2013 recipient of a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award. Rodriguez has had solo exhibitions at Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, New York, NY; Cooper Cole, Toronto, ON; Kerlin Gallery, Dublin, Ireland; Western Exhibitions, Chicago, IL; Artpace, San Antonio, TX; McNay Art Museum, San Antonio, TX; and Lulu, Mexico Ciy, Mexico.

This marks his first solo exhibition with Nohra Haime Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe View from Nowhere references American philosopher Thomas Nagel\u2019s idea that a united and global view of the world is impossible, that essentially, our view always starts from nowhere. Cortes uses his scientific upbringing and natural artistic abilities in this aptly named exhibition to illustrate humanity\u2019s varying points of view on the mysterious forces of astronomical happenings in the universe. \r\n\r\nComprised of 7 sculptural installations, or \u201ctranslation machines\u201d, he interprets vast concepts like dark matter and black holes into intelligible art on a micro scale. Each work references a particular scientific question in connection with authentic scientific research. \r\n\r\nIn Variation 1, Cortes plays with the discovery that while black holes are known to absorb and destroy, they can also transform energy and exchange particles with white holes. This beautifully-crafted device uses colliding sound waves and LED lights that force small black \u201cparticles\u201d to levitate in mid-air between two conical disc - one black, one white. The artist strives to break down an enormous and problematic occurrence into a perceivable phenomenon that can be observed with the human eye. \r\n\r\nIn the tripod-like Variation 2, Cortes demonstrates the similarly impossible estimation of mapping the universe using scientific data downloaded from the internet. Events in the universe, such as solar flares, trigger a lamp inside the device that projects ethereal light patterns on the wall. While these situations are nearly impossible to truly replicate or translate on a small scale, the challenge of doing so is brilliant in its own way. \r\n\r\nDeciphering the greatness of our universe into an understandable scale is ambitious with humanity\u2019s limited point of view. Each model proposes a tantalizing challenge to grasp something that cannot be grasped. We must accept that complex scientific questions cannot always be resolved, therefore allowing the line of understanding to become blurred in our \u201cview from nowhere\u201d.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1989, Juan Cort\u00e9s lives and works in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. An audiovisual artist and lecturer in Art and Audiovisual Media at the University of Los Andes, Colombia, Cort\u00e9s works in the areas of research and interdisciplinary processes. He has exhibited both nationally and internationally, performing in institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York; Center for the Arts (CMA), Madrid, Spain; Bilbao Exhibition Center, Spain; Fridman Gallery, New York; NYC Creative Tech Week; and Centquatre-Paris, France. He is cofounder and curator of the RADAR Video Art Festival and the SATELLITE Festival of Sound Art, and regularly works with the Hyphen-Hub space for artistic and community creation. He is the recipient of numerous awards such as the VII Bogot\u00e1 Prize for Alternative Art Spaces in Colombia and the prestigious PRAC Grant of the Ministry of Culture of Colombia.

We are faster, stronger, better. We are digital. We are artificial. We are intelligent. We don\u2019t have enough space but we have enough experience. We are connected, we are loud, we are confident. We have all the info we need.  We have time. We manipulate time. We know the past, we know the future. We are the future, but somehow, we can\u2019t even predict the weather. If the world has become wretched and damaged, if humanity is futile, \u201chow shall we dress for the occasion?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis exhibition, featuring artists Chulayarnnon Siriphol, Deniz Tortum, Kathryn Hamilton and P&#305;nar Yolda&#351;, considers our obsession with future scenarios and how we try to make sense of  personal mortality, technological progress and environmental collapse, simultaneously. Are we experiencing the \u201cend of the future\u201d or the \u201cend of  history\u201d? How do we fight the accelerated passage of time? Why do we take measures to undo the effects of time? How does it feel to worry not only about our personal time but how much time the generations to come will have on earth? How do we think about the relationship between value and time, when there is an expiration date to humanity\u2019s existence on earth? How shall we dress for the occasion? invites the audience to contemplate our multiple, contradictory experiences of time.\r\n\r\nARK (2020), a video installation by Deniz Tortum and Kathyrn Hamilton, is a visual essay that positions virtual reality as a potential stand-in for immortality. Exploring a series of nascent 3D archives, ARK catalogues both the precious and the mundane, making no assumptions about what will survive and what will disappear in the future. While extinction may be inevitable, 3D modelling and digital technology offer a way to freeze time and disrupt its linear path. Using the literal disembodiment inherent to VR to underscore the growing sense of isolation and loss in highly digitized lives, ARK asks the viewer what is at stake when we can no longer count on eternity.\r\n\r\nChulayarnnon Siriphol\u2019s video installation, Golden Spiral (2018), opens with the following lines:\r\n\r\nYou are staring at space, at empty space.\r\nThis is the space that we are currently at.\r\nA white space, timeless, borderless, endless.\r\nOur space is moving through time.\r\nOur space is moving at a constant velocity.\r\nOur space is moving at a constant acceleration.\r\n\r\nIn this immersive work, the viewer is shuttled from space to forest, encountering dinosaurs, deep sea fish, and ancient fossils in one moment, and confronting the damage humans have inflicted on the earth in the next. In Golden Spiral, our relationship to time, the earth and extinction is explored again, this time with a humorous but sharp-edged critique of consumerism. Through sweeping visual contractions of timespace, the work addresses disappearance and change in the natural world on a grand scale. Then, the gaze narrows to the individual fight against time, as a commercial-style narrative about a miraculous anti-aging gel unfolds. Both the installation space and the video are inhabited by a series of painted golden shells, embodying the tension between the natural and the artificial. By engaging both planetary destruction on a millenial scale and personal obsessions with aging, this work challenges us to reconsider our complex relationship to time and nature.\r\n\r\nP&#305;nar Yolda&#351;\u2019s Regnum Alba (2015) offers yet another entry point into global fears around mortality and extinction. Regnum Alba is Latin for \u201cwhite kingdom\u201d, and the work is a photo collage that reflects on the environment and established hierarchies in the natural world. The work includes over 50 animals with reduced pigmentation, a genetic mutation known as leucism. Several scientific papers draw a positive correlation between environmental pollution and leucism, especially in fish. This \u201ckingdom of no color\u201d underscores the destructive effects of humans on the environment and industrialization\u2019s unfulfilled promises.

Transit, 1977-1987 at the Bronx Museum", "description": "Located at 1040 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York 10456\r\n\r\nWidely regarded as one of the most significant documentarians of street art, Henry Chalfant has produced a voluminous body documenting the emergence of the trend since its early days in the Bronx, following its transformation into the international phenomenon it is today.\r\n\r\nChalfant\u2019s photographs are a work of visual anthropology and one of the seminal documents of American popular culture in the late twentieth century. Chalfant became interested in graffiti art when he arrived in New York in 1973, after graduating from Stanford University. By 1977, he had developed a technique of capturing exposures in rapid succession on his 35mm camera from different positions on the platform, documenting the entire train in multiple, overlapping shots.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the beginning of the graffiti era launched in the midst of a tumultuous time in New York City history, Henry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987 will feature documentation of works no-longer extant by legendary subway writers, including Dondi, Futura, Lady Pink, Lee Qui\u00f1ones, Zephyr, and including Bronx legends Blade, Crash, DAZE, Dez, Kel, Mare, SEEN, Skeme, and T-Kid. The exhibition also includes significant and rare historical ephemera and photographs that register the birth of hip hop. Henry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987 was originally produced for the Centro de Arte Tom\u00e1s y Valiente in Madrid, Spain, and curated by SUSO33.\r\n\r\nAbout Henry Chalfant\r\nStarting out as a sculptor in New York in the 1970s, Chalfant turned to photography and film to do an in-depth study of hip-hop culture and graffiti art. One of the foremost authorities on New York subway art, and other aspects of urban youth culture, his photographs record hundreds of ephemeral, original artworks that have long since vanished. His archive of over 1,500 photographs is represented exclusively by Eric Firestone Gallery, New York and East Hampton. He co-authored the definitive account of New York graffiti art, Subway Art (Holt Rinehart Winston, N.Y. 1984) and a sequel on the art form's world-wide diffusion, Spray Can Art (Thames and Hudson Inc. London, 1987). Chalfant co-produced the PBS documentary, Style Wars, the definitive documentary about Graffiti and Hip Hop culture and directed Flyin' Cut Sleeves, a documentary on South Bronx gangs, in 1993. He produced and directed Visit Palestine: Ten Days on the West Bank in 2002. His film From Mambo to Hip Hop was featured in the Latino Public Broadcasting series, Voces in 2006-2007, and won an Alma Award for Best Documentary.\r\n\r\nHenry Chalfant: Art vs. Transit, 1977-1987 is generously supported by KAWS, Michael D. & Kristin Elkins, David Forbes and Velda Turan, Janet Goldman, Hal & Jodi Hess, Supreme, Powerhouse Arts, Philip & Cheryl Milstein, Kickstarter, Eric Firestone Gallery, Sacha Jenkins & MassAppeal, Rob Cristofaro & Alife, Shepard Fairy, and Anne Brown.", "artforumID": 177042, "showStart": "2019-09-25T04:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-08T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id13202/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Eric Firestone Gallery | New York", "galleryDescription": "Eric Firestone Gallery maintains cross generational programming that places contemporary artists within an historical context.", "address": "4 Great Jones Street\n3rd Floor", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10012", "lng": -73.9938815, "lat": 40.727774313673, "hours": "Tue - Sat 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "ericfirestonegallery.com", "galleryEmail": "efg@ericfirestonegallery.com", "phone": "9173243386", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.775Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.775Z"}, {"id": 26, "title": "Waiting for Omar Gatlato: Contemporary Art from Algeria and its Diaspora", "description": " THE WALLACH ART GALLERY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESENTS\r\nWAITING FOR OMAR GATLATO: A SURVEY OF CONTEMPORARY ART\r\n FROM ALGERIA AND ITS DIASPORA\r\n\r\nExhibition Will Be on View at the Wallach October 26, 2019 - March 15, 2020\r\n \r\nNEW YORK, October 4, 2019 \u2013 Columbia University\u2019s Wallach Art Gallery will present Waiting for Omar Gatlato: A Survey of Contemporary Art from Algeria and Its Diaspora, on view from October 26, 2019 through March 15, 2020. The exhibition, an expansive examination of Algerian decolonial visual aesthetics, is curated by Natasha Marie Llorens, a Ph.D. candidate in Columbia\u2019s Department of Art History and Archaeology.  \r\n  \r\nThe exhibition borrows its title from a 1979 publication on early Algerian film, edited by Wassyla Tamzali, which references Samuel Beckett\u2019s play Waiting for Godot and Merzak Allouache\u2019s 1976 cult classic film Omar Gatlato. The exhibition title combines two important conceptual clues for how contemporary Algerian visual artists and filmmakers approach and engage art as the decolonization process evolves. Both source works are portraits of anti-heroes trying to make sense of their day-to-day lives.\r\n \r\nThe Waiting for Omar Gatlato exhibition advances diverse representations of everyday life in Algeria and its diaspora through film, paintings, photography and sculpture. There are works by 25 artists, including Louisa Babari and C\u00e9lio Paillard, Fay\u00e7al Baghriche, Bardi, Mouna Bennamani, Adel Bentounsi, Zoulikha Bouabdellah, Halida Boughriet, Fatima Chafaa, EL Meya, Hakima El Djoudi, Karim Ghelloussi, Mounir Gouri, Mourad Krinah, Amina Menia, Sonia Merabet, Yazid Oulab, Lydia Ourahmane, Sadek Rahim, Dania Reymond, Sara Sadik, Fethi Sahraoui and La Chambre Claire, Massinissa Selmani, Fella Tamzali Tahari, Djamel Tatah and Sofiane Zouggar. \r\n\r\nChallenging historical contradictions and representations is a consistent theme of the artworks in the exhibition. Fethi Sahraoui's 2019 photography book Triangle of Views and its \"Escaping the Heatwave\" essay contain images of children ingeniuously finding ways to cool themselves off in abandoned water towers, irrigation channels and streams of agricultural runoff in a country with roughly 1,000 miles of Mediterranean coastline, which is inaccessible for many of those living just 40 miles inland. Fatima Chafaa\u2019s 2019 photographic installation My Father\u2019s Painting: Fatma d\u2019Arc or Jeanne N\u2019soumer addresses how the representation of strong femininity has been circulated and transformed over centuries as a cultural practice. Dania Reymond highlights the Algiers botanical garden, Jardin d\u2019Essai du Hamma, as a projection of the colonial imagination onto the existing landscape and as a space for fantasy in her 2016 film Jardin d\u2019Essai.\r\n\r\n\u201cWaiting for Omar Gatlato responds to the visual and imaginative obscurity that blankets Algeria,\u201d said the curator Natasha Marie Llorens. \u201cThe reasons for Algeria\u2019s lack of artistic representation at the international level are complex: 130 years of settler colonialism by the French engendered both a robust literary and artistic legacy in France\u2019s own image. As a result of an unrelenting yet ambivalent struggle for self-determination at every level of the sociocultural sphere, no digestible, unified narrative has emerged for the West to understand Algeria.\u201d\r\nAdded Betti-Sue Hertz, the Wallach Gallery\u2019s new director and chief curator, \u201cI am excited about the presentation of Waiting for Omar at the Wallach, as we continue along the vein of igniting conversations around representation, within historical legacies and contemporary art. With this exhibition, Columbia provides an in-depth view of individual expressions across an evolving Algerian cultural landscape.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter it closes at the Wallach, Waiting for Omar Gatlato will be expanded to include works from the collection of the National Centre for Plastic Arts of France, as well as new commissions by several emerging artists. The exhibition will be presented at La Friche de la Belle de Mai in Marseille in June 2020, at the invitation of Triangle France / Ast\u00e9rides in conjunction with Manifesta 2020.\r\n \r\nThe 298-page Waiting for Omar Gatlato catalog, co-published by Sternberg Press, includes the first English translations of texts by key theorists of Algerian contemporary art on the evolving relationship between art and politics, as well as poetry by Samira Negrouche and a graphic essay by Nawel Louerrad. The catalog will be available for purchase at the Wallach Art Gallery.\r\n\r\nWaiting for Omar Gatlato: A Survey of Contemporary Art from Algeria and Its Diaspora has been developed through the generous support of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. Additional support has been provided by Etant Donn\u00e9s Contemporary Art, a program developed by FACE Foundation and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States, with lead funding from the French Ministry of Culture and Institut Fran\u00e7ais-Paris, the Florence Gould Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, Chanel USA, the ADAGP and the CPGA.\r\n \r\nAbout Columbia University\r\nAmong the world\u2019s leading research universities, Columbia University in the City of New York continuously seeks to advance the frontiers of scholarship and foster a campus community deeply engaged in the complex issues of our time through teaching, research, patient care and public service.

This is the gallery\u2019s second exhibition of the artist, following the 2014 exhibition \u201cLife in Flower: 1971-1979.\u201d The exhibition is from January 17 to February 29, 2020. \r\n\r\nIssei Suda (b. 1940 \u2013 d. 2019) began his long and celebrated career in 1967 as a stage photographer of avant-garde Japanese theatre. His travels through Japan during the early 1970s inspired much of his work at the time and concentrated on street scenes. He discovered the random beauty of textures and patterns in nature, and of ordinary people in their everyday habitat. Throughout his career, Suda demonstrated an innate ability to show people as latent participants existing in the highly charged space between the ordinary and the extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition, in tribute to Suda\u2019s legacy, features approximately 25 monochrome prints selected from his 1996 monograph entitled Human Memory which won the Ken Domon Award. In the postscript of the book, Suda describes his snapshots of strangers and everyday scenes as a strong reminder of himself, identifying within the gaze of his subjects a very personal connection. He also believes a photographic image, even its fragment, reflects on the human emotions that are woven into everything around us \u2013 people, materials, nature, and therefore can reinvigorate a ghost-like ambiguous memory, often disorienting time and place.\r\n\r\nThe works in the exhibition were taken from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in various Japanese towns and cities. The scenery is often drab and austere. The vulnerability and naivety the viewer might feel perhaps stem from the rapid economic and cultural changes in Japan at the time. Suda typically pares his capture down and eliminates anything unnecessary from his square frame so that the viewer is drawn to ruminate on the mysterious essence of the subject. The extraordinary aspects of the everyday reveal themselves through Suda\u2019s unique worldview. He is able to capture a reality not often seen by the naked eye, that is created during the moment of capture by the photographer without \u201cthinking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of Issei Suda has been shown since the 1970s in numerous museum exhibitions, including \u201cA Self-Portrait,\u201c International Center of Photography, New York 1979; \u201cJapanese Photography in the 1970s \u2013 Memories Frozen in Time,\u201d Metropolitan Museum of Photography, Tokyo 1991; and \u201cThe History of Japanese Photography,\u201c Museum of Fine Arts, Houston 2003, Nagi no Hira- Fragments of Calm,\u201d Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, Tokyo (2013).

Wainwright Gallery.\r\n\r\nIs a home a sanctuary? Throughout history, we have built shelters to protect from the elements, intruders, and animals of prey, but at a certain point, people wanted more than just a hideout or shelter. Issues such as privacy, family needs, and personal comforts began to influence the types of residences that were built and lived in. The idea of home moves beyond the concept of a place to live or a place of shelter, and connects to ideas of identity, safety, one\u2019s place in the world, as well as a foundation for a lifetime, and a place to leave\u2026and possibly return to. When does a house provide the sanctuary of a home? When is home really a sanctuary?\r\n\r\nThe idea of sanctuary, whether physically, emotionally or intellectually, is important in shaping a sense of self-hood and community. However, in our current political climate, the right to a safe haven is threatened, and the necessity for compassion is greater than ever. For many, sanctuary can signify a sacred place, a refuge, a ritual, a haven or an oasis, while for others, it can also mean home, family, community, religion, and identity, or even a place for thoughts, ideas, hopes, dreams, and a form of comfort in times of trouble.\r\n\r\nWe can take sanctuary in our memories, habits, and routines, and we can seek sanctuary for not just for our bodies, but for our hearts and minds as well. Sanctuaries can be created for ourselves, those we love, or those fleeing conflict, prejudice, and persecution. We create sanctuaries to protect and preserve ecosystems and the flora and fauna dependent on them. Seeking to address these issues and ideas, this exhibition offers a multiplicity of perspectives on the idea of home; shelter, protection, sacred ground, identity, sense of place, community and belonging.\r\n\r\nWhat does home mean to you: is it only four walls and a roof, or is it something more?", "artforumID": 179912, "showStart": "2019-12-19T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-05-03T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16072/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Lucia Hierro", "gallery": "Children's Museum of the Arts", "galleryDescription": "Founded in 1988, Children\u2019s Museum of the Arts\u2019 unique curatorial program introduces children and families to contemporary art.", "address": "103 Charlton Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10014", "lng": -74.0081544, "lat": 40.727616413673, "hours": "Mon 12pm to 5pm, Fri 12pm to 5pm, Sat - Sun 10am to 5pm, Thu 12pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "cmany.org", "galleryEmail": "cma@cmany.org", "phone": "212-274-0986", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.780Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.780Z"}, {"id": 57, "title": "Tie Me Up!

Camel Collective is comprised of Anthony Graves and Carla Herrera-Prats. Carla Herrera-Prats passed away in December 2019 after a two-year fight against cancer.\r\n\r\nTo describe this new exhibition, Anthony Graves writes:\r\n\r\n\"One year ago this February Carla and I were discussing the declaration of a state of emergency at the Mexico\u2013US border as ICE and US Border Patrol agents were assigned the tasks of incarcerating people\u2014Q. and babies? A. and babies\u2014fleeing economic injustice and political violence in their home countries. We thought back to a residency we had in Marfa, Texas in 2013 and to some of our research on the joint US and Mexico survey that mapped the line of the post-war border. (The Mexican-American War ended Feb 2, 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo giving the US Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and marking the Rio Bravo [Rio Grande] as the Southern Texas border.) In our research, we had come across Arthur Schott, a botanist and artist, who himself had fled a failed revolution in Germany, and who was hired to map a third of the border. His topographical landscapes intrigued us not only because they were some of the first circulated images of the region, but because of the artistic surplus of stylistic and iconographic material he included in them. Schott populated his foregrounds with botanical and zoological studies using a drawn line that was unmistakably imported from German Romantic landscapes of the time. The drawings went well beyond the mandate of his task to create a workable topography of the region that could be instrumentalized to settle property disputes, dispossess those who fell outside of its logic, and clarify the post-war division of national territory. The US popular imagination, reduced and simplified in right-wing rhetoric, fantasizes a border as a line or a wall, a discrete two-dimensional demarcation that ignores the multidimensionality of the lived experience of thousands who cross it every day for the purposes of labor, family, sustenance\u2026. Love and death haunt this imaginary line, an unreadable graffiti left in traces on the earth, a cyphered line, a guardrail for the wicked or the suffering. The notion of the border as a discrete line is ridiculous, reductive, a violence to thought. It extends not only deep into the geographical territory of a nation-state and its history, but penetrates into our very psyches generating exclusions and exceptions. \r\n\r\nCarla and I thought we should take up this subject again, and so we proposed an exhibition to Takako Tanabe at Ulterior, to take place one year after the state of emergency was declared, to think about lines, political boundaries, landscape, imagined territories, lines of flight, history, and, once again, for us, about blindness. The works presented in this exhibition continue our practice of materializing research and examining and speculating on production from a labor perspective, that is, from the perspective of our imprint on materials and the realities, for good and ill, that those marks create. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition includes a new work in video, two stone border markers and the imaginary line drawn between them connecting a stonecutter\u2019s workshop outside Mexico City and a gallery in New York, a series of prints that link over a hundred-and-fifty years of surveillance and political imagination (or lack thereof), and a series of drawings that connect the geography and temporality of a revolution in Germany (1848) with the landscape of the Northwest Mexico border region, the US Southwest (1857\u2013present).\"\r\n\r\nCamel Collective was formed in 2005 as a research group during a fellowship at the Whitney Independent Study Program. Anthony Graves  and Carla Herrera-Prats  have worked together solely as Camel Collective since 2010. Their works are motivated by research into marginal histories and critical pedagogies, and employ various media and methods including video, sculpture, performance, photography, paintings, and installation. Camel Collective has exhibited and performed at museums and exhibitions including MUAC, Mexico City (2017); REDCAT Gallery, Los Angeles (2015); Trienal de Artes Frestas, Sesc, Sorocaba, Brazil (2015); the Bard Hessel Museum, Annendale-on-Hudson, New York (2014); Casa del Lago, Mexico City (2013); Trienal Poli/Gr\u00e1fica de San Juan, Puerto Rico (2012); MASS MoCA, North Adams, Massachusetts (2011); and Aarhus Kunsthalle, Denmark (2010). Camel Collective has also exhibited works at Artists Space, Art in General, Exit Art, New York, NY; Black Ball Project, Brooklyn, NY;  and the Sala de Arte P\u00fablico Siqueiros, Mexico City. Their video Something Other Than What You Are is currently showing as part of Landmarks at UT Austin, TX, and is also on view at ESPAC in Mexico City.", "artforumID": 181088, "showStart": "2020-01-25T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-08T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17248/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Camel Collective, detail of, \u2026 in the absence of a middle ground..., 2020.

The exhibition presents a video and accompanying installation which comment on alienation, the myth versus reality of the artist figure, and self-representation. Dealing with the loss of legal ownership of a character he invented at the axis of his work, Mandy is portrayed as a solipsistic artist, who becomes increasingly desperate to piece together who he is\u2014both personally and artistically\u2014now that the central focus of his art practice is gone.\r\n\r\nIn a text accompanying the exhibition, independent curator Loreta Lamargese writes, \u201cThe question of artistic license, often romantically conjured as an open field of play, is closed down and stifled by the bureaucratic structures that grant us further access to one\u2019s creations. Within these new confines, Mandy\u2019s journey takes us from an intimate conversation with his partner, his reading of Kathy Acker and Roland Barthes, to finally landing wryly on his adoption of a new artistic medium, quilts. With Wendy occupying the role of Walter Scott\u2019s alter ego, the emergence of Mandy opens up an infinitely regressive field of identifications. This reverberating grid of persons and their potential doubles, is a site as emancipatory as it is claustrophobic.\u201d\r\n\r\nWalter Scott (born 1985) is currently an artist-in-residence at ISCP. Scott is an interdisciplinary artist working across comics, drawing, video, performance and sculpture. His comic series, Wendy, chronicles the continuing misadventures of a young artist in a satirical version of the contemporary art world.  Wendy has been featured in Canadian Art, Art in America, and the New Yorker. It was selected for the 2016 edition of Best American Comics, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, New York. Recent exhibitions include Who Isn\u2019t She? A Wendy Retrospective, Galerie UQO, Gatineau; Slipping on the Missing X, Macaulay Fine Art, Vancouver; and Betazoid in a Fog, Remai Modern, Saskatoon. Scott\u2019s new graphic novel, Wendy, Master of Art, will be available from Drawn & Quarterly in Spring 2020. Scott\u2019s residency is supported by a Canada Council for the Arts grant supporting the arts and cultures of First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis Peoples.\r\n\r\nMajor support for this exhibition is provided by Canada Council for the Arts.

It opens on Friday, January 10th with a reception from 6:00 to 8:00 pm, and continues through Saturday, February 22nd. The artist will be present at the opening.\r\n\r\nThe Optimates presents three distinct scenes: a person stands at a podium; a man, seen from behind, speaks to someone unknown; and a group of men huddle in conversation at a window. The works are large in scale; some exceed life-size. All are made with charcoal, graphite and pigment on paper. Two are mounted on panels, and the other is presented loose, pinned to the wall.\r\n\r\nBaker crops her images to draw attention to specific details. The way a hand grips a podium in Mouthpiece, the overgrown haircut in Pomp and Sycophants, and the framing of Assembly of Elders around an illuminated cross in the window all stand out as a result of Baker\u2019s careful composition. It isn\u2019t immediately apparent in every work who the subject is, but signifiers indicate the immense power the subject wields. They wear dark suits and crisp white shirts, and several are pictured in richly adorned rooms. These are the people, we are meant to intuit, who possess wealth, class, and authority. They are also, clearly, all middle-aged or older white men, and Baker provides just enough context clues to suggest that they are either the focus of attention, or the ones cutting the back room deal. The exhibition title is a further nod to their status; the Optimates in ancient Rome were conservatives who favored rule by oligarchy and opposed immigration and assistance for the urban poor.\r\n\r\nAlthough Baker presents these men as anonymous, her works are based on actual photos of real politicians: Presidents, senators, and others from both sides of the aisle make appearances. Their facelessness is a comment on the mutability of their identities. Political movements rise and fall, and regimes change; but the symbols of power\u2014and the institutions that concentrate that power in the hands of a few\u2014remain the same. In this respect, the dark outlook offered by The Optimates is echoed by Baker\u2019s flat, depthless expanses of matte black charcoal. Power has infinite potential to corrupt\u2014regardless of the subject.\r\n\r\nMelanie Baker (b. 1955, Columbus, OH) makes charcoal drawings that deal with the concepts of power and masculinity in politics, history, and finance. Baker\u2019s work has been exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, Jersey City Museum, NYU\u2019s Gallatin Galleries, Ramapo College, Keene College, and Lehman College. In 2003 the artist received a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship as well as the New York Foundation for the Arts Prize. Residencies and fellowships include the Art Omi International Artists\u2019 Colony; Sacatar Foundation in Bahia, Brazil; Tyrone Guthrie Center at Annaghmakerrig, Ireland; Valparaiso in Mojacar, Spain; and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council\u2019s Workspace program.

Including a range of materials, they rejected the exclusive notion that art is an extension of its creator\u2019s inner sentiments, and gave precedence to the viewer\u2019s unique and intimate interactions with a work of art.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Responsive Eye Revisited,\u201d alternatively, looks to the past while remaining firmly grounded in the present. The exhibition includes a selection of works by contemporary artists \u2014 Beverly Fishman, Warren Isensee, Markus Linnenbrink, and Patrick Wilson \u2014 alongside artists who themselves participated in the original exhibition or were active in the decades in-between \u2014 Josef Albers, Karl Benjamin, Gene Davis, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, John McLaughlin, Kenneth Noland, and Al Held. \r\n\r\nIllustrating an inclusive understanding of the power of abstract painting, \u201cThe Responsive Eye Revisited,\u201d highlights how contemporary artists masterfully apply the medium of paint with a sensual quality capable of engaging both the mind and body. As David Pagel writes, \u201cAlthough their materials are conventional, what they do with them is anything but. They make paint sing\u2014silently and like nothing else out there.\u201d", "artforumID": 180647, "showStart": "2020-01-14T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16807/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Miles McEnery Gallery | 21st Street", "galleryDescription": "Miles McEnery Gallery specializes in modern and contemporary art.

Opening on Thursday, January 30, 2020, the exhibition will feature a selection of the artist\u2019s large-scale, densely layered, and intricately detailed paintings from 2017 to 2019. Nilsson\u2019s recent works are her first on canvas since the early 1990s, and her largest since the 1970s.  \r\n\r\nLike the meticulously constructed watercolors and collages for which she is best known, Nilsson\u2019s recent paintings are filled to the brim with winding, playful imagery and make full use of their monumental scale. In Boating (2018), a skirted woman with aquamarine skin perches above her male companion, with one of her feet balanced on his shoulder and the other on the side of their canoe. Despite the woman\u2019s acrobatic impulse, she\u2019s heavy and unbalanced. Her arms, head, neck, and breasts flail autonomously. Her facial expression adds to the bizarre sexual narrative: A faint smile signals her willing participation, but her squinting eyes humorously hint at a kind of mental vacancy. \r\n\r\nDistracted by the voyeuristic opportunity, her male companion is unconcerned with the precarious tilt of the boat, which threatens to send them overboard at any moment. In line with her characteristic use of hierarchical scale and horror vacui, the artist fills the composition with lilliputians, their bodies as unruly as our female protagonist\u2019s. \r\n\r\nNilsson first came to prominence in 1966, when she joined five other recent School of the Art Institute of Chicago graduates (James Falconer, Art Green, Jim Nutt, Suellen Rocca, and Karl Wirsum) for the first of a series of group exhibitions called the Hairy Who. The artists\u2019 styles were assertively idiosyncratic, but most had trained with professors Kathleen Blackshear and Paul Wieghardt and adapted some of their respective Surrealist and German Expressionist tendencies. Nilsson skillfully integrates elements of both in her playful investigations into human sexuality and its inherent contradictions. In many ways, Nilsson\u2019s recent works mark a return to the ambition and scale of those early works that helped establish the Hairy Who. She was the first member of the group\u2014and one of the first women in history\u2014to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1973.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Nilsson accepted a teaching position at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she is now a professor.                   \r\n\r\nSince 1966, Nilsson\u2019s work has been the subject of more than fifty solo exhibitions, including sixteen at Phyllis Kind Gallery (1970\u20131979, 1981\u20131983, 1987, 1991, and 1994, Chicago and New York), two at The Candy Store (1971 and 1987, Folsom, California), and one at Hales Gallery (2019, London). Her work has also been featured in many important museum exhibitions, such as Human Concern/Personal Torment (1969, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York); Who Chicago? (1981, Camden Art Center, London); Parallel Visions: Modern Artists and Outsider Art (1992, Los Angeles County Museum of Art); Chicago Imagists (2011, Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Wisconsin); and What Nerve! Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present (2014, Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence). Most recently, Nilsson\u2019s work appeared in The Candy Store (2018, Parker Gallery, Los Angeles), Hairy Who? 1966\u20131969 (2018\u20132019, School of the Art Institute of Chicago), Chicago Imagists from the Phyllis Kind Collection (2019, Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago), and How Chicago! Imagists 1960s\u20131970s (2019, Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art, University of London).                \r\n\r\nNilsson\u2019s work is featured in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Wisconsin; the Milwaukee Art Museum; the Morgan Library, New York; the Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut.                    \r\n\r\nGarth Greenan Gallery is pleased to represent Gladys Nilsson.             \r\n\r\nGladys Nilsson: Recent Paintings will be on view at Garth Greenan Gallery, 545 West 20th Street (between Tenth and Eleventh avenues), through Saturday, March 14, 2020.

Focusing on the artist\u2019s compositions of landscapes and cities, this show surveys more than 30 years of Salvo\u2019s artistic practice and highlights his early conceptual art and his astounding aptitude for portraying the complexities of light and the passage of time. Organized in collaboration with Archivio Salvo, the works in this show solidify Salvo\u2019s singular and ever explorative approach to artmaking and his lasting impact on Italian modernism. \r\n\r\nSalvo, whose given name was Salvatore Mangione, was born in Leonforte, Sicily, in 1947. After permanently relocating to his adoptive city of Turin in 1968, he quickly became involved in the blossoming Arte Povera movement, which was born as a response to the social and political unrest in Italy throughout the 1960s. During this period, Salvo shared a studio with Alighiero Boetti, one of the pioneers of this radical movement. Salvo and Boetti had an ongoing relationship and reciprocally collaborative influence on each other\u2019s practices; the combination of influences from Boetti and other artists of the time impacted Salvo\u2019s own artmaking and understanding of the world around him. At this early stage in his career, Salvo employed conceptual strategies to meditate on the nature of artistic practice, and the role of the artist as both a preternaturally talented individual and a conduit to the past and the history of culture. An example of works from this period include a series of \u201cself-portraits\u201d - altered or staged photographs that depicted him as a baker, bartender, guerilla, saint, and the painter Raphael. By 1973, Salvo pivoted away from conceptual work and began to explore the radical and complex possibilities inherent to figurative painting. \r\n\r\nThe impulse Salvo felt to transform the nature of his work culminated in a powerful visual shift that preoccupied him for decades and resulted in a series of paintings with incredible depth, consistency, and nuance. Salvo\u2019s rebuttal to the monochrome aesthetic in the hyper-saturated, imagined landscapes and cityscapes he began to depict made him an artistic outlier until the international resurgence of painting in the 1980s. The works in this exhibition, painted between 1980 and 2011, harken back to avant-garde predecessors like Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carr\u00e0 in distilling real, imagined, and remembered spaces into a profound meditation on the passage of time. The pastoral scenes and quaint villages Salvo portrays are created with a vibrant palette of oil paints and reference architectural motifs and plant species native to the cities where he lived and worked. Unlike de Chirico and Carr\u00e0\u2019s visual response to industrialization and modernism, Salvo\u2019s paintings focus more specifically on complex psychological narratives and abstract concepts like time. This ability to translate the passage of time through his incisive approach to capturing differing lighting situations is further demonstrated by the titles of Salvo\u2019s paintings; many of the works on view are named after seasons, months, or times of day. The multifaceted body of work Salvo left behind solidifies his crucial place in the history of art and lasting influence on modern and contemporary artists alike. \r\n\r\nConcurrent to the exhibition, Gladstone will reprint Salvo: Della Pittura / On Painting / \u00dcber die Malerei (Buchhandlung Walther K\u00f6nig), the publication from the gallery\u2019s first exhibition with the artist in 1986. \r\n\r\nSalvo was born Salvatore Mangione in Leonforte, Sicily, in 1947 and lived and worked primarily in Turin until his death in 2015. Solo presentations of his work include the Museum Folkwang, Essen (1977); Mannheimer Kunstverein (1977); Kunstmuseum Lucerne (1983); Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1988); Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain, N\u00eemes (1988); Villa delle Rose, Bologna (1998); Galleria d\u2019Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Bergamo (2002); Galleria d\u2019Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Turin (2007); Museo d\u2019Arte della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, with Alighiero Boetti (2017).

IPCNY\u2019s New Prints Program is a biannual, juried open call for prints and print-based work that captures current voices and issues in contemporary printmaking.\r\n\r\nThroughout the jurying process, Ariana Barat, Gregory Burnet, Orit Mardkha-Tenzer, and Keris Salmon were collectively drawn to works that played with themes of domesticity and place. Burnet noted his affinity for \u201cthings we see all the time but maybe become too used to,\u201d including landscapes, domestic interiors, furniture, utensils, and even pets.\r\n\r\nFrom the jury\u2019s selections, a question arises: what makes these mundane spaces, objects, and relationships unique to an individual\u2019s experience? In Homebody, both homes and bodies serve as sites where individual memories can ruminate and grow, shaping personal perspectives on our surroundings and the world. These banal but necessary objects and dwellings, and the ways we interact and depend on them, shape our understanding of ourselves and of each other. Stella Ebner\u2019s Cricket, Glass & Business Reply Mail depicts an unexpected view of a kitchen floor, forming an abstraction of domestic space, and Evgenia Kim\u2019s Koryo Saram co-mingles textiles and traditions from her Uzbek, Korean, and Russian heritages as a path to defining her identity between diasporas.\r\n\r\nThe six awardees of the New Prints Artist Development Program will be announced at the opening reception on January 16.

Debuted at the 2019 Venice Biennale, May You Live in Interesting Times, this ambitious work will be exhibited for the first time in the United States. Doppelg\u00e4nger will concurrently be on view on at Victoria Miro, London, opening on January 31.\r\n\r\nSince the late 1980s, Douglas has created films and photographs\u2014and more recently theater productions and other multidisciplinary projects\u2014that investigate the parameters of their mediums. His ongoing inquiry into technology\u2019s role in image-making, and how those mediations infiltrate and shape collective memory, has resulted in works that are at once specific in their historical and cultural references and broadly accessible.\r\n\r\nDoppelg\u00e4nger is set in an alternative present. Displayed on two square-format, translucent screens, each of which can be viewed from both sides, the looped narrative unfolds in side-by-side vignettes that depict events on worlds that are light years apart. When one spacecraft embarks on its journey, another is launched at the same time in a parallel reality. Alice, a solitary astronaut, is teleported to a distant planet, and her double to another. Then, Alice and her ship, the Hermes II, for unknown reasons, return. Alice assumes her mission has failed and she has somehow returned home, but she has, in fact, arrived at a world where everything, from writing to the rotation of the sun, is literally the reverse of what she once knew.\r\n\r\nThe action on the two screens proceeds alternately in tandem and in parallel, seamlessly moving between two oppositional scenarios of Alice\u2019s reception back on Earth. In one version, Alice is received compassionately and welcomed home, whereas in the other, she is treated as an outlaw or a potential threat. Douglas intentionally heightens the viewer\u2019s feeling of displacement through a continual sense of reversal and mirroring, both in the form and content of his installation. Since the early 1990s, multi-channel video installations have been an integral part of Douglas\u2019s practice, allowing for the simultaneous presentation of multiple, overlapping narratives or vantage points, and with Doppelg\u00e4nger, he extends his ongoing exploration of both nonlinear narratives and alternate histories: the omnipresent sense of doubling that is built into the structure of the work implicitly suggests the possibility of simultaneous, diverging experiences and realities.\r\n\r\nIntercut with quasi-abstract passages of color and light, which nod both to avant-garde cinema as well as the history of space exploration, Doppelg\u00e4nger presents a nuanced and layered parable that powerfully addresses the slippery notion of objective truth, and the position of the \"other\" in contemporary society.\r\n \r\n\r\nStan Douglas was born in 1960 in Vancouver, where he continues to live and work. He studied at Emily Carr College of Art in Vancouver in the early 1980s. Douglas was one of the first artists to be represented by David Zwirner, where he had his first American solo exhibition in 1993.\r\n\r\nDouglas\u2019s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at prominent institutions worldwide since the 1980s. Splicing Block, a solo presentation of Douglas\u2019s work, is on view at the Julia Stoschek Collection in Berlin through March 1, 2020. Earlier this year, the artist was selected to participate in the 58th Venice Biennale, where he debuted Doppelg\u00e4nger and also presented a selection of photographs from his 2017 seriesBlackout. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, Stan Douglas: Luanda-Kinshasa was presented at P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), and Stan Douglas: The Secret Agent was exhibited at Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg. Stan Douglas: Interregnum was on view at WIELS Centre d\u2019Art Contemporain, Brussels, and Museu Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Berardo, Lisbon in 2015. In 2013, a major survey of the artist\u2019s work, Stan Douglas: Photographs 2008\u20132013, was presented at Carr\u00e9 d\u2019Art \u2013 Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain in N\u00eemes, France. It traveled as Stan Douglas: Mise en sc\u00e8ne through 2015 to Haus der Kunst, Munich, followed by Nikolaj Kunsthal, Copenhagen, and Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin.\r\n\r\nOther major solo presentations of the artist\u2019s work include those held at The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh (2014); Minneapolis Institute of Arts (2012); Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and W\u00fcrttembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart (2007); The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2005); Serpentine Gallery, London (2002); Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1994); and Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto (1987). The artist\u2019s work was featured in the Venice Biennale in 1990, 2001, 2005, and 2019, and in documenta in 1992, 1997, and 2002.\r\n\r\nDouglas\u2019s first multimedia theater production, Helen Lawrence, debuted at The Arts Club Theatre Company, Vancouver, in March 2014 and has subsequently been hosted by the M\u00fcnchner Kammerspiele, Munich; Edinburgh International Festival; Canadian Stage, Toronto; Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York; deSingel, Antwerp; and Center for the Art of Performance, University of California, Los Angeles (co-organized by Los Angeles County Museum of Art).\r\n\r\nDouglas has been the recipient of notable awards, including the Audain Prize for Visual Art (2019); the Hasselblad Foundation International Award in Photography (2016); the third annual Scotiabank Photography Award (2013); and the Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography, New York (2012).\r\n\r\nWork by the artist is held in major museum collections, including the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; The Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Solomon R.

This is a world that manifests the circuitous nature of time, the enmeshment of humans to the planet, and the shifting boundaries of earthly spaces. Rothberg and Zurkow present a series of systems that further human connection to oceans by way of action and imagination.\r\n\r\nAccretions is a series of silkscreens on repurposed packaging cardboard. Zurkow describes these works as masses of consumer goods: the result of what is bought, shipped globally, and discarded over time. Accretions relate the artist\u2019s generative animations from her series MORE&MORE, which depict the international exchange of goods via ocean freight.\r\n\r\nWater Without Wet (WWW) by Sarah Rothberg is a VR installation that examines the atemporal qualities of water. WWW engages two audiences, the headset-user, and the spectator. The user is immersed in a virtual world, instructed to enact simulations of everyday interactions\u2014drinking from a glass, flushing a toilet, watering a plant. The spectator watches the user simulating these actions, as well as two external displays of the virtual world. These renderings appear in different styles, from different viewpoints, and at different scales. At times chaotic and random, the procession of vignettes cycle out of the user\u2019s control. However, their actions cause the environment to become increasingly abstract and complex. WWW disrupts linear time to mirror the fluid and expansive consciousness of oceans.\r\n\r\nThe title of Zurkow\u2019s animation series, Oceans Like Us, uses pun and metaphor to express a desire for the ocean to love us. Part one of the series, Love Me, summons the elements that make oceans beloved: their soothing rhythms and splendiferous lifeforms, as well as our fetishistic enthusiasm for creatures both real and imagined. Milkcrate Plastisphere plunges into the deadly capitalist ocean of toxic plastics. Combining these opposites is Bow Null, a journey through the techno-ocean, buzzing with instruments of sensing, measuring, and monitoring that turn the ocean into a body to be dissected and penetrated, but also, perhaps, into a world to be known and respected.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the wet logic of the main exhibition, the front of the gallery exists in geologic time. Geological strata can make it seem as if our impact on the earth exists in a compact layer, fixed with a linear history. In this area, Toilet Joke I, a collaborative work by both artists, overflows with reground and pelletized plastic, unable to flush away more waste. An old phone plays a video of waves: the ocean virtualized. In Study for Toilet Joke II, positioned at the back of the gallery, the water in the fishbowl is physical. Where a fishbowl normally acts as a reminder of oceanic life in the dry world, Zurkow and Rothberg position it as a microcosm of the churning plastic, suspended in an infinite flush.\r\n\r\nOverall, the use of technology in this exhibition is purposeful in relation to its subject. The artists address the tension between dissolving, delirious immateriality and the consequences of material entanglements. Aspects of digital technology allow the artists to propose new watery philosophies\u2014for example, the software of this exhibition is non-linear and dislocating. Technology creates an interconnected mesh of relationships in a global network. While this network invites comprehension of the world on a more-than-human scale, it is also endemic to the cycle of extraction and e-waste, engendering consumption and desire without consideration of technology\u2019s tangible being.\r\n\r\nThis show marks the culmination of the artists\u2019 ongoing research into the fields of environmental and blue humanities. Influential sources include Philip Steinberg and Kimberley Peters\u2019 essay Wet Ontologies, Fluid Spaces, the artists\u2019 first-hand investigation of ocean habitats through swimming and snorkeling, and research into plastic composition and recycling capacities.\r\n\r\nA percentage of exhibition sales will go to Ocean Conservancy and Natural Areas Conservancy.", "artforumID": 180870, "showStart": "2020-02-06T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-15T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17030/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Image still from Oceans Like Us: Love Me, Marina Zurkow, 2020", "gallery": "bitforms gallery", "galleryDescription": "Founded in 2001, bitforms gallery represents established, mid-career, and emerging artists critically engaged with new technologies.", "address": "131 Allen Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10002", "lng": -73.990330953373, "lat": 40.720099685062, "hours": "Wed - Sat 11am to 6pm, Sun 12pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "bitforms.art", "galleryEmail": "info@bitforms.art", "phone": "+12123666939", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.815Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.815Z"}, {"id": 124, "title": "ANDY WARHOL PHOTOGRAPHY: 1967 - 1987", "description": "Jack Shainman Gallery is pleased to present an insightful exhibition of Andy Warhol\u2019s photographs, which span three decades of the artist\u2019s creative process. This exhibition creates a unique opportunity for viewers to appreciate this lesser known element of Warhol\u2019s practice, the subjects and techniques of which shed new light on Warhol\u2019s process and personal life. \r\n \r\n\r\nWarhol\u2019s photographic oeuvre remains one of the most central and enduring aspects of his creative process. Initially inspired by commercially available press photos of celebrities, such as iconic images of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Marlon Brando, as well as newspaper photographs of death and disasters, Warhol incorporated photographs as source material for the creation of his silk-screened paintings and prints. With the creation of a singular visual vocabulary, Warhol articulated his sensibilities while conveying his detached, observing eye through the use of a dispassionate machine: the camera.  Photography spanned the entirety of Warhol\u2019s career as he fused numerous genres of photo-making.\r\n \r\n\r\nBy the mid-1960s, Warhol\u2019s eye turned to the moving image as he began making 16mm black and white short films, dubbed Screen Tests, which featured his \u201cSuperstar\u201d Factory crew. Several Screen Tests are on view in this exhibition, including films that highlight Factory life, some very early notions of performance art, and the raw visual materials for Lou Reed\u2019s The Velvet Underground EP. These films catalyzed into Warhol\u2019s revolutionary conceptual feature-length films, including Sleep, Empire, and Heat.\r\n \r\n\r\nConcurrent with his exploration of film, Warhol utilized photobooths in Times Square to create serial images of art dealers, collectors, and bright young creatives who frequented the Factory. These strips became source material for some of Warhol\u2019s most iconic early portraiture, including paintings of art dealer, Holly Solomon, collectors, Judith Green and Edith Skull, and Warhol Superstars, such as Jane Holzer and Edie Sedgwick. Towards the end of the 1960s, Warhol began carrying with him a Polaroid camera used largely to document friends in his inner circle, including Mick Jagger, Diana Vreeland, Lee Radziwill, and Nan Kempner. Warhol referred to the Polaroid camera as \u201chis date\u201d \u2013 always with him, a tool for both engaging with his subjects, as well as a distancing mechanism.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 1977, Warhol\u2019s Swiss dealer, Thomas Ammann, presented him with the gift of a 35mm Minox camera, which became the artist\u2019s primary photo-making instrument until the time of his death in 1987. The resulting unique silver gelatin prints, which were produced during the final decade of Warhol\u2019s life, illuminate most comprehensively the artist\u2019s personal and artistic sphere. Warhol\u2019s final and most obscure body of work, a series of \u201cstitched photos,\u201d was created by sewing together these silver gelatin prints in serial panels of four, six, or nine identical images.  Nearly five-hundred stitched photo works were created in all, most of which are now in the permanent collections of global institutions. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis exhibition brings together one of the largest selections of Warhol\u2019s stitched photos, created within the culminating moment of Warhol\u2019s photographic oeuvre and, indeed, his entire career.  In January 1987, Robert Miller Gallery opened the sole photography show ever presented during the artist\u2019s life, as Warhol intended to make an incredible push for photography as a medium to be appreciated as a central part of his narrative and art-making processes. Six weeks later, Warhol died unexpectedly. Co-curated with Warhol specialist Jim Hedges, Jack Shainman Gallery is proud to cast Warhol\u2019s photography in a fresh new light.\r\n \r\n\r\nConcurrently on view through March 2020 is Meleko Mokgosi: Democratic Intuition at Jack Shainman Gallery | The School, 25 Broad Street, Kinderhook, NY.\r\n \r\n\r\nGallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 am to 6 pm.

The exhibition will open 9 January at 525 West 22nd Street and will remain on view through 15 February 2020. A public opening reception for the artist will be held on 9 January from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. A fully illustrated catalogue with an essay by art historian Michael Schreyach accompanies the exhibition.\r\n\r\nMichael Reafsnyder\u2019s abstract paintings are widely appreciated for their immediate sensuous appeal: vibrant, generously worked surfaces visualize luscious worlds of color and movement seemingly unencumbered by physical constraints. \r\n\r\nOn occasion, a disembodied Smiling Face or loopy personage\u2014perhaps Reafsnyder\u2019s signature motifs\u2014marks out territory in these sumptuous environments. Their presence adds narrative to what might otherwise be classed as pure abstraction. Yet these figures invite deeper contemplation, as Michael Schreyach suggests: \u201cOn a basic level, they control our pattern of visual scanning by soliciting us to follow their lines of sight or directional movement across the plane, laterally deflecting our views of deep space. More complex is what we might call their modes of existence. We are asked not only to notice the ways the personages are incorporated into or excluded from the field, but also to contemplate the character of the relationship between each personage and the environment in which it dwells.\u201d \r\n\r\nReafsnyder\u2019s slippery technique\u2014using planks of Plexiglas to swipe and slide plentiful applications of unmixed acrylic over large zones of canvas\u2014yields a visual abundance that confounds conventional descriptions of pictorial effect. Yet sustained looking will reveal the rigor of Reafsnyder\u2019s formal investigations. There is a seriousness to his work that exists in concert with his spirited and mischievous play. As in the art of Hans Hofmann, the manifest pleasure we may take in simply enjoying the quality of Reafsnyder\u2019s surfaces is accompanied by our thoughtful engagement with his art, which rewards our attentive regard.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL REAFSNYDER (b. in 1969 in Orange, CA) received his Bachelor of Arts degree in studio art at Chapman University in Orange, CA in 1992 and his Master of Fine Arts degree at the Arts Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA in 1996.\r\n\r\nHe has had numerous exhibitions internationally.

Consistently, his paintings present a compelling tension between the gestural and the impersonal; in recent times this has been characterized by fluid, torquing, extended marks that reveal the viscosity of paint and the speed of color and light in a flattened manner that looks photographic or filmic.\r\n\r\nWhen Reed came to New York from Southern California in the 1960s, he entered an art scene skeptical about painting\u2019s ability to be progressive. The young artist sympathized with the humanist, even metaphysical impulse in the work of painters such as his teachers Philip Guston and Milton Resnick, even as he admired the deadpan materiality of contemporaneous conceptual experiments in sculpture and film. Seeking to make paintings that were as direct as a poured steel sculpture, between 1974 and 1975 he prepared tall vertical canvases, either as single panels or as several panels bolted together; their height was determined by the door to his studio, their width by the limits of his own reach.

The show will be on view from January 9 to February 29, 2020 and marks Pylypchuk\u2019s first solo exhibition at the gallery\u2019s Chelsea location in nine years.\r\n\r\nAn expression and result of Pylypchuk\u2019s past and current years as a rock musician (he is a founder of KISK, the KISS cover band) and as an artist, the paintings featured in Waiting for the Next Nirvana are imbued with nostalgia, anticipation, energy, confidence, and, foremost, seductive and rebellious emotion. The works, with titles such as I don\u2019t need flowers, I just need you, Basketball season is over cupcake!, and Your goodness keeps this badass begging are made of fabric, wood, glue, watercolor, glitter, black cue balls, and polyurethane, among other materials, and evoke feelings of existential angst.\r\n\r\n\u201cGuns n Roses took a swing at the establishment in 1987 with Appetite for Destruction, and garbage cans across the Southland were loaded with hairspray canisters that would never be used again,\u201d says Pylypchuk. But \u201cby 1991, in four short years Guns n Roses had become the establishment. Lush orchestration, epic songs, backup singers, extra musicians to fill out the sound, Axl Rose seated behind a piano\u2026Long gone were the days he would dive off stage to punch someone in the face who\u2019d pissed him off. Now he wouldn\u2019t even go on stage until he \u2018felt right\u2019 and everything was perfect.\u201d So much for Grunge; much less teen spirit.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think mainstream rock music has been shook up, re-envisioned, made exciting again,\u201d says Pylypchuk, who is also known by his alter ego Rudy Bust. \u201cBy 1994 Kurt Cobain blew his brains out. Maybe it was heroin, maybe it was stomach pain, maybe it was fear about where music was going. In any case, that ended it and we were left with Creed and Nickelback and a host of others who profited on sounding like safe substitutes.\u201d\r\n\r\nPylypchuk stopped trying to be a rock star in 1995 because, he says, \u201cI wasn\u2019t good at writing songs. Instead, making things without thinking, pulling things out of the nothingness, gluing shoelaces and scraps of things to paper and making them talk, documenting my anxieties over mortality was where I landed. Art had no rules and still shouldn\u2019t. Things weren\u2019t perfect then and they aren\u2019t perfect now. That time in my life was my first nirvana.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor this exhibition Pylypchuk has conjured a body of work that has been marinating for 20 years. \u201cI have been sitting in the studio for the past year looking at my paintings and asking myself \u2018Could I be the next Nirvana?\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nPylypchuk is a multidisciplinary artist who works in painting, sculpture, installation and video. Working with simple materials (fake fur, wood, fabric, sheet metal, beer cans, electric light bulbs, polyurethane foam, etc.), Pylypchuk reinterprets the collage and bricolage practices derived from Art Brut. Often his \u2018creatures\u2019 draw upon the animal world to explore the frailty of human existence and social relationships. Pylypchuk\u2019s characters seem to have lost their way, appearing in a wounded condition, harmed by either themselves or by others. They combine a hearty dose of cynicism and anger at the unfairness of it all with a wicked sense of survivalist humor.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1972 in Winnipeg, Canada, Pylypchuk studied at the University of Manitoba School of Art, where he co-founded the collective known as the Royal Art Lodge in 1996 with fellow artists Michael Dumontier, Marcel Dzama, Neil Farber, Drue Langlois and Adrian Williams. Its members were mostly graduates from the University of Manitoba, Canada who were united in their outsider status and who liked to break the unwritten rules of artistic production. They sent childlike drawings to the National Gallery of Canada, suggesting they exhibit them, and held all-night drawing sessions. In 1998 he moved to Los Angeles, where he is currently based.\r\n\r\nSince coming to international attention, Pylypchuk has exhibited in New York, D\u00fcsseldorf, M\u00fcnster, London, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Paris, San Francisco, Miami, Tokyo, Montreal, Seoul, Guadalajara and St. Petersburg. His works are in the collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Saatchi Collection, London; The Museum of Old and New Art, Berriedale; and the Whitney Museum, New York.\r\n\r\nPetzel Gallery is located at 456 West 18th Street New York, NY 10011.

As our globalized society becomes increasingly marked by emigration, resettlement, and technological interconnectedness, so too have notions of the self become exponentially fractured and complex. Through the work of seventeen artists, Xenia: Crossroads in Portrait Painting captures the ways in which artists are leveraging the power of the portrait to express these intricacies, exposing the relationship between identity, place, and shifting social norms. The exhibition will be on view from January 11 through February 15, 2020, across both of Marianne Boesky Gallery\u2019s Chelsea locations at 507 and 509 West 24th Street.\r\n\r\nXenia: Crossroads in Portrait Painting will feature new and recent works by a wide range of artists, including Polina Barskaya, Amoako Boafo, Cristina Canale, Somaya Critchlow, Ndidi Emefiele, Maria Farrar, Nona Garcia, Cindy Ji Hye Kim, Doron Langberg, Otis Quaicoe, Laura Sanders, Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum, Rodel Tapaya, Salman Toor, Hannah van Bart, Robin F Williams, and Chloe Wise. The group of artists were born and currently live across five continents and over twenty countries, many having relocated by choice or necessity. \r\n\r\nAcross their vivid and insightful portraits, the individual is depicted as both of singular and communal experience, and as reflecting multiple signifiers of acceptance, displacement, environment, consumerism, and cultural references. In instances, the figure is amputated, aggregated, and multi-acculturated; it is shown within empty expanses and amongst other bodies and objects. Yet despite the spectrum of perspectives and the various formal and conceptual approaches, the artists\u2019 visions are united by a central sense of humanity.\r\n\r\nThis connection is also encapsulated in the exhibition title, which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of \u201cxenia\u201d or \u201cguest-friendship\u201d. This notion is mentioned in Teju Cole and Fazal Sheiekh\u2019s 2019 book, Human Archipelago, and refers to the extension of generosity to visitors from afar. Together, the artists\u2019 work speaks to the multicity of factors that shape identity\u2014thus highlighting that \u201cotherness\u201d is purely notional. And at the same time, the act of painting another being can be seen as an act of xenia itself.  \r\n\r\n\u201cThroughout art history, portraits have served as indicators of social values and personal circumstances. The incredible reemergence of the genre speaks to its ongoing power to reflect our perceptions of ourselves and the world we occupy.

This exhibition creates a unique opportunity for viewers to appreciate this lesser known element of Warhol\u2019s practice, the subjects and techniques of which shed new light on Warhol\u2019s process and personal life. \r\n \r\n\r\nWarhol\u2019s photographic oeuvre remains one of the most central and enduring aspects of his creative process. Initially inspired by commercially available press photos of celebrities, such as iconic images of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Marlon Brando, as well as newspaper photographs of death and disasters, Warhol incorporated photographs as source material for the creation of his silk-screened paintings and prints. With the creation of a singular visual vocabulary, Warhol articulated his sensibilities while conveying his detached, observing eye through the use of a dispassionate machine: the camera.  Photography spanned the entirety of Warhol\u2019s career as he fused numerous genres of photo-making.\r\n \r\n\r\nBy the mid-1960s, Warhol\u2019s eye turned to the moving image as he began making 16mm black and white short films, dubbed Screen Tests, which featured his \u201cSuperstar\u201d Factory crew. Several Screen Tests are on view in this exhibition, including films that highlight Factory life, some very early notions of performance art, and the raw visual materials for Lou Reed\u2019s The Velvet Underground EP. These films catalyzed into Warhol\u2019s revolutionary conceptual feature-length films, including Sleep, Empire, and Heat.\r\n \r\n\r\nConcurrent with his exploration of film, Warhol utilized photobooths in Times Square to create serial images of art dealers, collectors, and bright young creatives who frequented the Factory. These strips became source material for some of Warhol\u2019s most iconic early portraiture, including paintings of art dealer, Holly Solomon, collectors, Judith Green and Edith Skull, and Warhol Superstars, such as Jane Holzer and Edie Sedgwick. Towards the end of the 1960s, Warhol began carrying with him a Polaroid camera used largely to document friends in his inner circle, including Mick Jagger, Diana Vreeland, Lee Radziwill, and Nan Kempner. Warhol referred to the Polaroid camera as \u201chis date\u201d \u2013 always with him, a tool for both engaging with his subjects, as well as a distancing mechanism.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 1977, Warhol\u2019s Swiss dealer, Thomas Ammann, presented him with the gift of a 35mm Minox camera, which became the artist\u2019s primary photo-making instrument until the time of his death in 1987. The resulting unique silver gelatin prints, which were produced during the final decade of Warhol\u2019s life, illuminate most comprehensively the artist\u2019s personal and artistic sphere. Warhol\u2019s final and most obscure body of work, a series of \u201cstitched photos,\u201d was created by sewing together these silver gelatin prints in serial panels of four, six, or nine identical images.  Nearly five-hundred stitched photo works were created in all, most of which are now in the permanent collections of global institutions. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis exhibition brings together one of the largest selections of Warhol\u2019s stitched photos, created within the culminating moment of Warhol\u2019s photographic oeuvre and, indeed, his entire career.  In January 1987, Robert Miller Gallery opened the sole photography show ever presented during the artist\u2019s life, as Warhol intended to make an incredible push for photography as a medium to be appreciated as a central part of his narrative and art-making processes. Six weeks later, Warhol died unexpectedly. Co-curated with Warhol specialist Jim Hedges, Jack Shainman Gallery is proud to cast Warhol\u2019s photography in a fresh new light.\r\n \r\n\r\nConcurrently on view through March 2020 is Meleko Mokgosi: Democratic Intuition at Jack Shainman Gallery | The School, 25 Broad Street, Kinderhook, NY.\r\n \r\n\r\nGallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 am to 6 pm.

Musical lyricism and the wildness of nature inspire these vibrant paintings, which embrace sensuality and earthly delights as a counterbalance in an increasingly informational age.\r\n\r\nGarden Riot reveals a new boldness in color in Eby\u2019s work, as she finds herself re-engaging with the core tenets of her practice. An accomplished classical pianist, Eby has always been influenced by the lyricism, rhythm, and cadence of music. As she deepens her study of harmonic structure, Eby finds she can hear more musical color and textures. This has directly influenced the unbridled gestures and new color relationships in this body of work. In Garden Riot, Eby explores new techniques in her encaustic method, combining layers of hot wax and cold wax, ink and pigments, as she pushes for new depths of color, saturation, and movement.\r\n\r\nThis series celebrates the pleasures of all things sumptuous and sensual and riotous and life affirming, a release from the concerns of daily life. It can often seem like we live in a time of intense polarity and cultural tensions, an age dominated by information. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the dueling nature of man,\u201d Eby writes. In response, Eby encourages viewers to turn toward light and recognize the brilliance of everything, \u201cfrom the light within all of us to the larger, cosmic organism of which we are all a part.\u201d Garden Riot offers a return to splendor.\r\n\r\nBetsy Eby received her BA from the University of Oregon. She and her husband, painter Bo Bartlett, split their time between studios in Columbus, Georgia, and Wheaton Island, Maine. She savors the spaciousness and light of both of these studios, and her paintings evoke the atmosphere of the vast ocean that surrounds her small island residence in Maine.

Though both women were making art in the 1940s, they came from vastly different backgrounds and achieved art world recognition in the opposite manner. Sobel received critical attention during her lifetime at the epicenter of New York cultural circles, while Blauvelt created in complete anonymity, her drawings only discovered years after her death. Both artists currently have work on view in the recently completed rehanging of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. \r\n\r\nJanet Sobel was born in a small town in the Ukraine, emigrating to New York in her teens. It was only later in life, as a housewife, after having raised a family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, that she took up painting. According to New York Times art critic Roberta Smith, Sobel\u2019s work evolved from \u201cprimitivist figuration that recall[s] early Chagall and presage[s] early Dubuffet,\u201d to an abstract mode, including a drip technique she devised that influenced Jackson Pollock and arguably \u201chelp[ed] to invent Abstract Expressionism.\u201d Sobel\u2019s work was championed by surrealists Andr\u00e9 Breton and Max, as well as by gallerist Sidney Janis. In 1945, Peggy Guggenheim included Sobel in the group exhibition \u201cThe Women\u201d at her Art of This Century gallery and gave her a solo show the following year. It was there that critic Clement Greenberg and Jackson Pollock first saw her work. Greenberg later acknowledged Pollock\u2019s artistic debt to Sobel.  \r\n\r\nPearl Blauvelt\u2019s Dutch ancestors settled in the Hudson Valley in upstate New York and helped found the First Dutch Reformed Church in that region in the late 1600s. At some point during the early decades of the 20th century the artist moved with her father to a house in a small town in northeastern Pennsylvania where she would spend most of her adult life, about which little is known. In the 1970s she was moved to a mental facility outside of Scranton where she would continue to draw until her death in 1987. Artist couple Donna and Dennis Corrigan discovered a box filled with about 800 of her drawings after they purchased the house, which had been long abandoned, some 50 years after the artist last lived there.  \r\n\r\nBlauvelt\u2019s colored pencil drawings on lined notebook paper appear to serve as the imaginative recollections of a woman who lived a humble life on the margins of mainstream society. They depict everyday subjects like people strolling along country lanes, horse-drawn carriages, railway tracks, banknotes, front porches, furniture, women\u2019s undergarments and other clothing from mail-order catalogs. Her characters are often set in fictionalized scenes from the Bible. While her determination to accurately capture the proportions, shapes and surface textures of her varied subjects evokes a somewhat childlike approach, Blauvelt\u2019s pictures are also marked by unexpected sophistication as she exaggerates certain details and reveals multiple perspectives with peculiar, X-ray-like, see-through views into the interiors of buildings. \r\n\r\nThe Janet Sobel works selected for this exhibition are oils and gouaches from the 1940s. Colorful evocations of Russian-Jewish shtetls, many of these pictures are densely packed with renderings of peasants, soldiers, flower gardens and floating heads set against watery backgrounds. Over time, Sobel\u2019s lyrical work became more dreamlike and technically more inventive, exemplified in the 1943 painting, Disappointment. Her art evolved from early folkloric representational images, to abstract-figurative and then all-abstract creations.  \r\n\r\nSobel later moved to New Jersey, stopped painting, and was for a time largely forgotten. Over the last two decades her work has been rediscovered with gallery shows at Gary Snyder (2002, 2010), D.C. Moore (2005) and James Barron (2016, 2018). In 2016, Sobel was included in \u201cAbstract Expressionism,\u201d curated by David Anfam at the Royal Academy of Arts (London) that later traveled to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2018, three paintings (among them Pro & Contre from 1941 which will be on view in this exhibition) were included in the National Gallery of American Art\u2019s (Washington DC) exhibition \u201cOutliers and American Vanguard Art.\u201d In 2021, the Pompidou Center (Paris) will feature Sobel in the exhibition \u201cWomen in Abstraction.\u201d \r\n \r\nJanet Sobel\u2019s art is included in the permanent collections of the American Folk Art Museum (New York), The Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (Bentonville, AK), the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington D.C.), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York). \r\n\r\nPearl Blauvelt\u2019s drawings were recently featured in \u201cFlying High: Women Artists of Art Brut\u201d at the Bank Austria Kunstforum Wien in Vienna and in \u201cYou Can\u2019t Win: Jack Black\u2019s America\u201d at the Fortnight Institute in New York. Her work is currently on view in the exhibition \u201cMemory Palaces: Inside the Collection of Audrey B. Heckler\u201d at the American Folk Art Museum. Blauvelt\u2019s art is held in many notable private and public collections including the Museum of Modern Art (New York), The Museum of Everything (London), Collection abcd (Paris) and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia).  \r\n\r\nThis show has been organized in cooperation with Gary Snyder Fine Art, and James Barron Art / Ashley Shapiro, the Granddaughter of Janet Sobel.", "artforumID": 181041, "showStart": "2020-01-11T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17201/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Janet Sobel, Pro &amp; Contre", "gallery": "Andrew Edlin Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Andrew Edlin Gallery has been focused on outsider and contemporary art since 2001.

This series of work takes the form of sonic headwear, acoustic sculptures built from brass instruments, and graphic scores, all of which build upon World War II audio tactics such as jamming signals, coded messages, and warning sirens, reimagining them in sculptural form as vehicles for present-day protest and deception. \r\n\r\nThese systems are mapped out across the gallery with trumpet pipes welded into sprawling abstract lines, diagrammed and layered on paper scores, or compiled into looming brass speakers and noise intoners. In the piece ASMR \u00c9tude, Parker recreates wearable acoustic locators through which one can hear popular Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, or ASMR, recordings made to treat anxiety, PTSD, and insomnia. Another piece, titled Ghost Box, requires visitors to activate the sculpture through touch, initiating different looped audio clips of coded songs from the Underground Railroad, coded transmissions like Morse Code, and jamming signals of Soviet Russia and Communist China. Together, these constructions chart a multitude of possible choreographies for each listener to embody their sonic components, implicating the listener\u2019s body as a site for receiving and issuing calls to action. Engaging auditory tools associated with early twentieth century political conflict and war, Parker invites us to listen closely to the ways that sound can be used to incite resistance, disrupt systems of control, and ease anxiety and illness.\r\n\r\nDrawing upon the listening philosophies of composers Pauline Oliveros and John Cage, Parker\u2019s work meditates on the possibilities for sound to affect the listener\u2019s body. In her catalogue essay, Lilia Rocio Taboada writes: \u201cWithout a key or legend to assist the viewer, the compositions hover between maps, musical scores, and dance notations\u2014all visual tools to spur physical action on the part of a viewer or performer. As with his&#8232; sound works, Parker offers a participatory tool, but leaves interpretation open to the viewer\u2019s aural or physical response.\u201d Entangling twentieth century technology and theory with somatic inquiry offers an opportunity to better understand connections between the past and present as we envision the future. In doing so, Parker asks us to consider the ways in which sonic systems historically used for violent ends might be manipulated to serve as both an invitation to collective action and a means for community building and healing.\r\n\r\nSteve Parker is an artist, musician, and curator who creates communal, democratic work to examine history, systems, and behavior. He is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship, a Harrington Fellowship, and the Tito\u2019s Prize. Parker has exhibited and performed at institutions, public spaces, and festivals internationally.

The most common forms of symmetry are reflection, which most people think of as bilateral; rotation; inversion; and translation, which is just moving an object in a line. . . . But the thing about symmetry is it\u2019s invisible. It does not proclaim itself. It\u2019s there, you know, and it has a structural reality.\r\n\u2014John Mason\r\n\r\nGagosian is pleased to present Geometric Force, an exhibition of ceramic works by the late John Mason.\r\n\r\nOne of the most visionary ceramic artists of the last century, Mason brought his medium into conversation with Abstract Expressionism by extending the physical and spatial properties of clay. He began his career on the West Coast in the 1950s, as part of a group of artists who studied with the pioneering ceramist Peter Voulkos at the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles. Mason and his contemporaries challenged conventional ideas about ceramics, making large, abstract, subversive works. Mason worked at scale, his wall reliefs and expressionistic sculptural works matching the ambitious painting and sculpture of the era. In his Los Angeles studio, which he shared for a time with Voulkos, they began employing industrial techniques and technologies: humidifiers from fruit packing plants, which allowed clay to stay pliable for longer periods of time; heavy-duty dough mixers; and a custom-built kiln that enabled him to fire works six feet in height, often using up to two tons of clay at a time.\r\n\r\nMason showed frequently at the renowned Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles during the 1950s and \u201960s\u2014including in the gallery\u2019s inaugural exhibition, and four solo exhibitions\u2014and exhibited consistently in the United States over the following decades. He saw a resurgence of interest in his work later in his life, and participated in exhibitions such as Pacific Standard Time: Crosscurrents in L.A. Painting and Sculpture, 1950\u20131970 at the Getty Center in 2011\u201312 and the Whitney Biennial in 2014. In recent years, contemporary artists as diverse as Shio Kusaka, Sterling Ruby, Ed Ruscha, and Jonas Wood have cited him as an important influence.\r\n\r\nThe works in this exhibition, which span Mason\u2019s early career to the years preceding his death at age ninety-one in 2019, attest to the range and vocabulary of his innovation and experimentation in clay. Standing almost six feet tall, Orange Cross (1963) is glazed in a rich hue that recalls the desert landscape of Nevada, where Mason grew up. These earthy tones, along with shades of blue reminiscent of an open sky, recur throughout his work. Orange Cross encapsulates many of Mason\u2019s evolving concerns, including tensions between geometry and materiality, and open and closed forms. Smaller works demonstrate his ability to shift his scope in terms of form and scale. His \u201corbs\u201d are made from geometric circles and right angles, fitting together in modular formation with no single beginning, end, top, or bottom.\r\n\r\nOften cited as a contributor to the \u201crevolution in clay,\u201d Mason changed the perception of the medium from craft into fine art, mixing Western and Eastern influences. The material result is something completely sui generis and hard to trace\u2014untethered to a single genre or movement, yet related to many.", "artforumID": 180708, "showStart": "2020-01-10T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16868/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Gagosian | Park & 75", "galleryDescription": "Gagosian is a global network of art galleries specializing in modern and contemporary art with sixteen exhibition spaces worldwide.", "address": "821 Park Avenue", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10021", "lng": -73.961951394478, "lat": 40.772997565086, "hours": "Tue - Sat 10am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "gagosian.com", "galleryEmail": "parkand75@gagosian.com", "phone": "+12127961228", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.800Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.800Z"}, {"id": 110, "title": "A Strange New Beauty", "description": "Petzel Gallery is pleased to present A Strange New Beauty, a solo exhibition of new works by Troy Brauntuch. The show, which will be on view from January 15 to March 7, 2020, marks Brauntuch\u2019s eighth show with the gallery and his second at the Upper East Side location.\r\n\r\nFrom 1937\u20131944, Germany\u2019s Nazi regime engaged in cultural practices including the curation of large-scale exhibitions entitled the Great German Art Exhibitions (Gro\u00dfe Deutsche Kunstausstellungen [GDK]). Indicative of the regime\u2019s ideology, these exhibitions, which took place in Munich, included artworks that were collected by elite members of German society at that time. Documentation of these exhibitions have been compiled by GDK Research, who \u201cpublishes unknown photographic documents\u2014evidence of art that was subsidized by the state during the NS era\u2014in order to make source material available for critical discussion and analysis of the Nazi regime\u2019s art and cultural policies.\u201d The primary source material of A Strange New Beauty is this expansive photographic archive.\r\n\r\nBrauntuch\u2019s exploration of this archive allows the imagery of the Great German Art Exhibitions to generate new meaning within our current socio-political climate. Manipulations of these images paired with fashion advertisements from major newspaper publications lead one to consider how ideology can transcend generations and normalize into quotidian spaces. A Strange New Beauty in many ways acts as a \u201cre-archiving\u201d of the GDK chronicles within Brauntuch\u2019s visual practice. Brauntuch\u2019s manipulations, deletions, and additions of information to the images that went on to become the central works of this exhibition, exposes the ease by which information in sensitive archives can be manipulated and referenced at later points in time, as truth.\r\n\r\nUsing techniques such as industrial letterpress printing, traditional photographic processes, and metal image substrates such as magnesium, the image production of this exhibition mimics the reproduction methods of early 20th century Europe. In fusing these processes with digital image manipulations, a conversation with historical narratives and political movements past and present is the undercurrent of Brauntuch\u2019s work in A Strange New Beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly respecting history but I\u2019m also accepting it as my found object\u2014my way of looking at something,\u201d Brauntuch told Allie Biswas of The Brooklyn Rail in 2016. \u201cI think I am reusing something that operates in the world, and I am finding this strange beautiful setting that allows it to be re-presented and allows it to be beautiful.\u201d\r\n\r\nBorn in 1954 in New Jersey, Troy Brauntuch graduated from the California Institute of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. He currently divides his time between New York, NY and Austin, TX. His work has been exhibited both nationally and internationally for over forty years.\r\n\r\nBrauntuch exhibited in the seminal show \u201cPictures\u201d at Artists Space in 1977 in New York, along with Jack Goldstein, Robert Longo, Philip Smith, and Sherrie Levine. His works are held in numerous private and public collections including the Pinault Foundation in Paris; The Museum of Modern Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; The Dallas Museum of Art; The San Diego Contemporary Arts Museum; and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Brauntuch\u2019s work was included in \u201cDay for Night,\u201d the 2006 Whitney Biennial in New York. In the summer of 2007 a survey exhibition of his work from 1990\u20132007 was exhibited at the Magasin-Centre National d\u2019Art Contemporain in Grenoble, France. In 2009, his work was included in \u201cThe Pictures Generation, 1974\u20131984,\u201d at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2010, JRP/Ringier published a monograph book of works from 1975\u20132008.  His work was recently featured in \u201cWhere Art Might Happen: The Early Years of CalArts\u201d at the Kestner Gesellschaft in Hannover, Germany, which travels to the Kunsthaus Graz in Austria in 2020.\r\n\r\nPetzel Gallery is located on the parlor and third floors of 35 East 67th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, New York.

As our globalized society becomes increasingly marked by emigration, resettlement, and technological interconnectedness, so too have notions of the self become exponentially fractured and complex. Through the work of seventeen artist, Xenia: Crossroads in Portrait Painting captures the ways in which artists are leveraging the power of the portrait to express these intricacies, exposing the relationship between identity, place, and shifting social norms. The exhibition will be on view from January 11 through February 15, 2020, across both of Marianne Boesky Gallery\u2019s Chelsea locations at 507 and 509 West 24th Street.\r\n\r\nXenia: Crossroads in Portrait Painting will feature new and recent works by a wide range of artists, including Polina Barskaya, Amoako Boafo, Cristina Canale, Somaya Critchlow, Ndidi Emefiele, Maria Farrar, Nona Garcia, Cindy Ji Hye Kim, Doron Langberg, Otis Quaicoe, Laura Sanders, Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum, Rodel Tapaya, Salman Toor, Hannah van Bart, Robin F Williams, and Chloe Wise. The group of artists were born and currently live across five continents and over twenty countries, many having relocated by choice or necessity. \r\n\r\nAcross their vivid and insightful portraits, the individual is depicted as both of singular and communal experience, and as reflecting multiple signifiers of acceptance, displacement, environment, consumerism, and cultural references. In instances, the figure is amputated, aggregated, and multi-acculturated; it is shown within empty expanses and amongst other bodies and objects. Yet despite the spectrum of perspectives and the various formal and conceptual approaches, the artists\u2019 visions are united by a central sense of humanity.\r\n\r\nThis connection is also encapsulated in the exhibition title, which takes its name from the ancient Greek concept of \u201cxenia\u201d or \u201cguest-friendship\u201d. This notion is mentioned in Teju Cole and Fazal Sheiekh\u2019s 2019 book, Human Archipelago, and refers to the extension of generosity to visitors from afar. Together, the artists\u2019 work speaks to the multicity of factors that shape identity\u2014thus highlighting that \u201cotherness\u201d is purely notional. And at the same time, the act of painting another being can be seen as an act of xenia itself.  \r\n\r\n\u201cThroughout art history, portraits have served as indicators of social values and personal circumstances. The incredible reemergence of the genre speaks to its ongoing power to reflect our perceptions of ourselves and the world we occupy. I find particularly fascinating the depth and diversity of approaches contemporary artists are taking to portraiture, and the way that their work so aptly encapsulates the complexity of identifying who you are and where you\u2019re from today. Xenia offers a sampling of some of the most exciting voices reshaping portraiture within contemporary practice and speaks to art\u2019s incredible ability to connect with social and political dialogues,\u201d said Marianne Boesky.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nFor more information about the artists featured in Xenia, please contact Gallery Director Mary Mitsch at mary@boeskygallery.com or 212.680.9889.

This exhibition follows the opening of the artist\u2019s most recent site-specific projection, Monument, commissioned by Madison Square Park Conservancy and on view January 16 through May 10, 2020.\r\n\r\nWodiczko\u2019s lifelong investigation of speech in public spaces aims to give voice to the marginalized and thereby generate an impetus for systematic change. Wodiczko\u2019s practice, which he terms \u201cInterrogative Design,\u201d combines art and technology with contemporary issues of urban, historical, and aesthetic culture. A House Divided\u2026 stands out as Wodiczko\u2019s first work that focuses on a population defined not by glaring injury, but by painful disagreement. The citizens of New York\u2019s Staten Island were recorded expressing their deeply felt political views. Through video projection, these recordings animate the faces, hands and feet of two statues of Abraham Lincoln as the interviewees\u2019 voices fill the gallery. Looming at eight feet tall and positioned to face one another as if in conversation, these \u201cLincolns\u201d engage in frank exchange, testifying to the divergent political views among members of a singular community and, in some cases, from within the same family.\r\n\r\nThe methodology behind A House Divided\u2026 was previously explored in My Wish (2017), a work commissioned and in the collection of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, South Korea. Similarly, Wodiczko brought members of Korean society together in unified social participation; participants sharing their unique experiences, hopes and dreams as their likenesses were projected on Kim Koo, the Korean independence activist. Wodiczko has previously given a public platform to marginalized voices such as mothers who have lost their children to murder (Bunker Hill Monument, Boston, Massachusetts, 1998), survivors of the Hiroshima atomic bomb (A-Bomb Dome Projection, Hiroshima Peace Memorial, Japan, 1999), and exploited female laborers (El Centro Cultural, Tijuana, Mexico, 2001) amongst many others.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition\u2019s title refers to the phrase \u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand\u201d from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1858 speech during an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate, which quoted a passage from the Bible, Matthew (12:22-28). Lincoln borrowed a familiar phrase in order to garner support for the contentious proposition of unifying a rapidly expanding nation teetering on the brink of war. Wodiczko repurposes the statement in a contemporary setting to highlight the partisan contention. In 2019, Wodiczko conducted research of suburban social landscapes in the Tri-State area before choosing Staten Island, a New York City borough that is racially and ethnically diverse yet a simultaneously politically divided geography: north as liberal-leaning and south as conservative-leaning.\r\n\r\nConcurrently at Madison Square Park is Monument, a site-specific public art installation that renders in high relief the diverse, difficult journeys of today\u2019s refugees. Commissioned by Madison Square Park Conservancy, the work will project the likenesses and spoken narratives of resettled refugees\u2014who have originated from different parts of the world\u2014onto the Park\u2019s 1881 monument to Admiral David Glasgow Farragut. A looping video projection will bring the monument to life with stories of displacement that illuminate how war, conflict, and political fallout impact individuals globally, encouraging visitors to consider how the history of conflict is memorialized.\r\n\r\nA feature length documentary on Wodiczko\u2019s practice, The Art of Un-War directed by Maria Niro, is anticipated to premiere in 2020.\r\n\r\nOn public buildings and monuments in more than 40 cities worldwide, Wodiczko has realized more than 90 site-specific projections. He has created projections on the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC (1988/2018); Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York (1989); Krak\u00f3w\u2019s City Hall Tower, Poland (1996); Boston\u2019s Bunker Hill Monument, Massachusetts (1998); Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland (2005); and Goethe-Schiller Monument, Weimar, Germany (2016). Recent survey exhibitions include Krzysztof Wodiczko: Instruments, Monuments, Projections, National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, South Korea (2017); Krzysztof Wodiczko, Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT) for Liverpool Biennial, England (2016); and Krzysztof Wodiczko: On Behalf of the Public Domain, Muzeum Sztuki in &#321;\u00f3d&#378;, Poland (2015). Wodiczko\u2019s instruments, vehicles, and documentation of his projections can be found in over 20 museum and public collections worldwide including the Museu d\u2019Art Contemporani de Barcelona, Spain; National Museum of Modern Art Kyoto, Japan; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Museum of Contemporary Art in Krak\u00f3w, Poland; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; and Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC. Wodiczko is currently a professor and director of the Art Design and the Public Domain program at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. He was formerly director of the Interrogative Design Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he was a professor in the Art Culture and Technology Program. Amongst many recognitions and awards, Wodiczko received the Hiroshima Art Prize in 1999.

Not in the performative sense but in the way they sail two ships: companion and spectator. In asking these four artists to participate, particularly in a show in a domestic environment, the intention with each was to bring into our apartment projects that brought the artist comfort in their studio, fabrications of characters in proximity. With Paul it was the intimacy of the lonely figure on a tiny screen, with Bernice it was the trickster mimicking her studio labors, with Maggie it was a heart on her sleeve, and with Ben it was his puppet.\r\n\r\nThe show transformed as we arbitrated four representations of duality into a single vessel: spectatorship. Whittled down, the crafted spectator is a witness with at least four disguises: a specter acting as unpredictably as Ben\u2019s pin hole camera lens; Bernice\u2019s shape-shifting, costumed observer aching for a pattern to clothe its presence; Maggie\u2019s secret soundtrack frames our ablutions with wet tempo; and Paul\u2019s icon unfolded to be visible, saturated with color and spectacle to seduce. \r\n\r\nMaggie Lee (b.1987, New Jersey) lives and works in New York.

Fifty Years of Painting", "description": "Matthew Marks is pleased to announce Gladys Nilsson: Honk! Fifty Years of Painting, the next exhibition in his gallery at 523 West 24th Street. Featuring thirty-three paintings and eighteen related drawings made between 1963 and 1980, the exhibition is organized in collaboration with Garth Greenan Gallery, where a selection of Nilsson\u2019s recent paintings are on view concurrently. Together the two exhibitions comprise the largest presentation of the artist\u2019s work to date.\r\n\r\nThough Nilsson is better known for the watercolors she began exhibiting in the mid-1960s as one of the original members of the Hairy Who, she has dedicated much of her career to painting with acrylic on canvas, panel, and Plexiglas. The earliest works in the exhibition depict brightly colored figures in enigmatic scenarios. In Honk (1964) a group of four figures at the left of the canvas confronts an uncannily similar group on the right, while in Nightclub (c. 1963\u201364) a giant lime-green face leers at a chorus line of dancers on an illuminated stage. Like many of Nilsson\u2019s paintings, both works include wood frames designed by the artist.\r\n\r\nIn 1966 Nilsson began painting on Plexiglas, applying paint to the opposite side so that it is seen through the clear plastic. Laying down each painting\u2019s layers in reverse order yielded more graphic compositions, as Nilsson explains: \u201cThe line is the first thing you put down, and everything else builds from that.\u201d Her largest painting on Plexiglas, Very Worldly (1967), is included in the exhibition. More than six feet wide, it abounds with hundreds of characters of every conceivable size and shape, many of them piloting fantastical vehicles. After 1970 Nilsson returned to working on canvas, and although graphic figures still populate her paintings, they are often anchored by a single protagonist. In both panels of the seven-foot-high Dipped Dick: Adam and Eve after Cranach (1971), a human silhouette is surrounded by a menagerie of cavorting plants and animals. As Nilsson describes her approach, \u201cI would draw a big figure, but that figure always needed another figure, and then those two figures needed a third to interact with. And then, before I knew it, the whole place would be teeming.\u201d \r\n\r\nGladys Nilsson Honk! Fifty Years of Painting is accompanied by a catalogue co-published with Garth Greenan Gallery. Including an interview by Alison Gingeras and more than one hundred full-color plates, it is the artist\u2019s most comprehensive publication to date.  \r\n\r\nGladys Nilsson (b. 1940) graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1962. With five other former students, including her husband Jim Nutt, she organized a series of exhibitions from 1966 to 1969 under the name the Hairy Who. In 1973 her work was the subject of a one-person exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Today her work is in the collections of museums across the United States, Europe, and Australia, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien in Vienna.\r\n\r\nGladys Nilsson: Honk! Fifty Years of Painting is on view from January 31 to April 18, Tuesday through Saturday, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

A Drawing Survey.", "description": "Over the course of a five-decade career, Jack Whitten (1939 \u2013 2018) made it his mission to disrupt the discipline of art history through experiments with material, process, and technique. He effectively constructed a bridge between gestural abstraction and process art, experimenting ceaselessly to arrive at a nuanced language of painting that hovers between mechanical automation and deeply personal expression. Though best-recognized as a painter and sculptor, Whitten was also a strategic and thoughtful draughtsman. Beginning 28 January 2020, Hauser & Wirth is pleased to present the first major survey of the artist\u2019s works on paper. This unique body of work serves as a testament to the immense investigation and exploration that Whitten pursued in order to make manifest his ideas and methods.\r\n\r\n\u2018Jack Whitten. Transitional Space. A Drawing Survey\u2019 illuminates the impressive breadth of the artist\u2019s career and practice. The exhibition demonstrates the artist\u2019s oftentimes playful dedication to his search for and discovery of his own visual language. Paper not only lent itself as an effective medium, it also provided Whitten a new space with infinite possibilities of freedom. Working on a two-dimensional plane enabled him to experiment with papers of varying qualities, as well as tools of his own creation. In this light, working on paper can be perceived as scientific research. With a hypothesis in mind, Whitten worked tirelessly to come to a conclusion about the sociocultural climate in which he lived, the history of art that he was attempting to subvert, and how to figuratively represent the many layers of information packed inside his mind.\r\n\r\nWorking on paper was an integral part of the artist\u2019s process and maturation, as well as his technical development and innovations. It is through his experiments with the properties of different papers and mediums that he was able to achieve and arrive at numerous processes and new techniques. He used everything from watercolor to toner, to cuttlefish ink, to homemade walnut ink, to an endless variety of Japanese and specialty papers. The trial-and-error of Whitten\u2019s methodology can be felt through the multiple versions and renditions he created of particular works, many of which served as preliminary studies for subsequent paintings and monumental series.", "artforumID": 180772, "showStart": "2020-01-28T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-04-04T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id16932/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Hauser & Wirth | East 69th Street", "galleryDescription": "Hauser & Wirth New York | 69th Street specialises in modern and contemporary art.

Each artist\u2019s work exists in a peripheral field within the gallery space in which the artworks are experiential \u2013 interacting with both the space of the gallery and the viewer. In order to describe the show, the concept acts more like an identifier and not a singular idea holding everything together. The main idea and question is, how does the viewer interact with the artworks, with the space where the artworks are installed, and how do the artworks interact with each other? Each experience will differ based on how the exhibition is approached and based on the individual viewer\u2019s observation and perception of what is in front of them. This is the intended way to experience the exhibition\u2014to interact by physically being there to observe. Documentation will give a glimpse into the exhibition through images, but this will be only one perspective, which is that of the photographer. Since exhibition titles are another method used to label or define a traditional group show, the title references simply the opening date: 01102020.\r\n\r\n01102020 is based on one\u2019s perception of our collective reality and loosely based around the simulation argument. In its minimal display of objects and installation it asks the viewer if what we are seeing is real or simulated, how we perceive the empty space in front of our eyes, and how we should interact within this reality.  \r\n\r\n01102020 will run from January 10 through February 16, 2020 at Fisher Parrish Gallery with an opening reception on Friday, January 10, 2020 from 7 \u2013 9pm.\r\n\r\nDoris Guo works in Queens.

On view are thirty-five gelatin silver photographs representing only a small portion of over 100,000 portraits captured during his lifetime. This is the second exhibition of portraiture at Westwood Gallery NYC by the Algerian photographer and focuses on Amazigh (Berber) women, circa 1950s to 1970s from his hometown of A\u00efn Be\u00efda (near the Aur\u00e8s Mountains), Algeria. This exhibition is one of a series of rediscovered artist estates, as part of the gallery core program.\r\n\r\nMansouri\u2019s portraits captured one of the last generations of Amazigh women to undergo the facial tattooing process. The tattooing is less practiced today, mostly due to the disappearance of the adasiya, wandering gypsy tattooists from Tunisia, and the growing Islamization in the Aur\u00e8s Mountains after the collapse of French Algeria in 1962. With the rise of Islam came the prohibition of tattooing as haram, and the veiling of women as mandatory. For most of the women who arrived to Mansouri\u2019s studio, this was the first time they had taken off their veil for any man except their husband, making the photographic archive Mansouri created exceptional. \r\n\r\nIn Mansouri\u2019s portraits on view, the fading tradition and history of Amazigh face tattoos is preserved on the faces of many women. The shapes, which include a sun (shams), a palm tree, a chain (cinsla), and flies (thabanat), were considered enhancers of beauty when applied to the face. Another significant shape is the diamond or eye of a partridge (ain hijla), which takes its symbolic significance from the partridge, a bird of great grace and beauty to Amazigh culture; its sharp eyes are thought as vigilant watchers against danger. \r\n\r\nHistorically, Amazigh women have been associated with freedom, boldness, and political leadership, and were fundamental to Amazigh culture in preserving rituality, orality, and art. This legacy can be traced back to pre-Islamic times, and the uncrowned Amazigh queen and warrior Kahina (born in the Aur\u00e8s Mountains in Algeria in the 7th century) whose name means \u2018prophetess\u2019 for her ability to foresee the future and lead her people to temporarily hold conquering Arab armies from introducing Islam to the local Amazigh tribes. Throughout North African history, Amazigh women were responsible for the orality of the Amazigh language, passing it down from generation to generation as an extension of the tribes\u2019 matrilineal beliefs. In addition, Amazigh women were the protectors and proliferators of art, expressing their skill into textile weaving, jewelry construction, and hand and feet decoration. \r\n\r\nMansouri described his respectful approach in photographing individual female portraits to document a centuries-old tradition:\r\n\u201cWomen often come accompanied by a relative.  They follow the man, veiled, not to be recognized in the street.  When they come in the studio they submit to my rules. The only person that comes in is the one who wants the photograph. The person to be photographed has some space to fix her or his appearance, a small hand mirror, one on the wall, a hairbrush and combs. Generally, women come wearing makeup, well dressed, with jewelry.  A certain distance is imposed otherwise it would be a sign of disrespect for a man to be too close to a woman. The clients are very different and it is almost impossible to tell who has been in a studio before and knows the procedure and who has never seen a camera and needs instruction. The approach has to be very delicate in order to avoid shame, especially since for some of them it is the first time when they are without veil in front of a man they are not related to. Sometimes, I have to intervene if the hair covers the face, or jewelry is not placed where it should be. Then I try to arrange it, but I take all the precautions of language and discretion.\u201d\r\n\r\nABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER\r\nWhen Mansouri was a child, he accompanied his grandmother to the local bazaar where he met a photographer who had a studio in back of a grocery store. The photographer later hired him and through an apprenticeship, Mansouri learned the craft of photography. Eventually, he left to open his own studio in the back of a barber shop, dedicated to portraiture. After years of documenting everyday people in the region, Mansouri inadvertently created a photographic archive, a legacy of images representing people and tribes rarely photographed. During this period, Algeria went through war and political turmoil as the country fought for independence from France; however, the stability of Mansouri\u2019s studio was evident in the thousands of people he documented.", "artforumID": 181162, "showStart": "2020-01-25T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17322/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Lazhar Mansouri (1932-1985), Untitled, circa 1960s [printed later]", "gallery": "WESTWOOD GALLERY NYC", "galleryDescription": "The gallery, established in 1995 in NYC, represents Contemporary and rediscovered prominent New York artists.", "address": "262 Bowery", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10012", "lng": -73.99327755, "lat": 40.72335126367, "hours": "Tue - Sat 10am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "westwoodgallery.com", "galleryEmail": "info@westwoodgallery.com", "phone": "+12129255700", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.820Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.820Z"}, {"id": 153, "title": "New York Meets Tbilisi: Defining Otherness - Part I", "description": "Assembly Room and Kunstraum LLC are pleased to present New York Meets Tbilisi: Defining Otherness-Part I, a group exhibition curated by Nina Mdivani, featuring works by Rusudan Khizanishvili and Juliana Cerqueira Leite, as part of the curator\u2019s investigation into the contemporary Georgian art in dialogue with New York-based artists.\r\n\r\nThe first part held at Assembly Room, focuses on works of Tbilisi-based painter Rusudan Khizanishvili (Tbilisi, 1979) and New York-based sculptor Juliana Cerqueira Leite (Sao Paulo,1981), while the second part of this exhibition features 12 Georgian and American artists and will be held at Kunstraum LLC, both shows culminate Mdivani\u2019s year-long curatorial residency at Kunstraum.\r\n\r\nThe main question this exhibition poses is how the phenomenon of Otherness is defined when examined in relation to two different cultures and understandings of the world, as well as considers onlookers\u2019 reactions when experiencing Otherness in the form of a person different from their own race, orientation, or background. Another subtler dimension of this important fundamental question is how Otherness is encountered within one\u2019s own persona, whether it be in the form of prejudice or shared historical and collective memory. \r\n\r\nAs Georgia has been undergoing significant transformation within the last thirty years, the country has to recognize its Soviet past, along with the mechanisms that have helped it to survive for centuries. Georgian art has mirrored this journey, at times reverting to mimicry through a Soviet or Western visual language, and at other times by producing strongly authentic work. Similarly, Otherness is experienced at many different levels in the United States that have led in the past to racial violence as well as to intra-cultural consensus. \r\n\r\nThe two artists presented in this exhibition work on the same theme of Otherness while producing two different and strong reactions, either of fear and hence a desire to dominate or of infatuation and hence a desire to own. As two women examine this theme through the mediums of painting and sculpture, they share an understanding that both of these impulses are strongly influenced by overarching patriarchal structures based on the philosophies of Darwin and perpetuated in colonial discourse. \r\n\r\nKhizanishvili uses her exceptional palette and vibration of primal colors to examine the dissonance present in contemporary society. Her canvases are populated by mysterious beings that lack ethnic Georgian attributes and resonate with more universal, archetypal meanings. One finds bodies of ancient goddesses and schematically portrayed stones melting under the heaviness of human histories. By assembling these fragments and then breaking them apart to be later reassembled into new fantastical beings, Khizanishvili mirrors the globally present feeling of ambiguity, fluidity, and distortion even more valid for her native country. In order for a woman to seize the identity of the Other in relation to the wider world, we women and representatives of \u2018alien\u2019 cultures, need to become like the structure that holds the power. \r\n\r\nCerqueira Leite\u2019s evocative clay objects function as evolutionary permutations or collection of sensory organs. By abstracting and manipulating separate parts of a head, her objects become representative of a category, rather than of a person, through the artist\u2019s intentional failure to convey subjectivity. By creating new species, Leite\u2019s works speak directly to Khizanishvili\u2019s metaphors, referencing the transition from the Other to the Undesirable. Both artists\u2019 works need to go through a transformation in order to become acceptable, more understandable, more conforming; yet Cerqueira Leite intentionally allows them to exist as \u2018failed heads.\u2019 In her work, she sees Otherness as a concept tied to the female body and dominant narratives of the Western world. By expressing otherness as bodily porosity, instability, and hybridity, she achieves a distorted reiteration of global society.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition brings together two distinct artists who come from the same generation and frame of mind while residing in two different parts of the world. Yet, they both investigate the failure of communication and desire, of meaning-making projections in the context of patriarchal and Western-oriented values. The visual language of art, as demonstrated by their respective practices, could and should empower us. \r\n\r\nThis collaboration between Assembly Room and Kunstraum LLC serves each\u2019s mutual mission of highlighting independent curators and thought-provoking exhibition concepts aiming to engage with the larger cultural discourse.\r\n\r\nNina Mdivani is interested in visual art as an ongoing, global process and expansion of contemporary feminist art that simultaneously enlarges our visual and cerebral boundaries.

This show marks her third solo exhibition with the gallery, which opens January 23rd and will remain on view through March 14th with an opening reception on January 23rd from 6 \u2013 8pm.\r\n\r\nThis series of new work highlights Tarver\u2019s continued interest in the history of colonialism and how it has affected the complicated narratives of contemporary black women in the western landscape. Employing scenes heavy with lush foliage and combining them with seductive domesticity, Tarver explores the problematic past of our ancestors and the impact of authentic versus inauthentic experiences. \r\n\r\nThrough examining parallels between slave trade channels and current cruise ship routes as well as travel advertisements and runaway slave ads, Tarver investigates the meaning of the word \u2018escape\u2019 - the escape of slaves from their captors in relation to the escape of the wealthy on luxury holiday trips to the tropics. The duality of this word accentuates the drastically different realities that individual cultures experience while also addressing the convoluted acceptance of a simplified colonial narrative. \r\n\r\nIn the large scale painting, Three Graces, Tarver was inspired by found photographs of three women in a 19th-century human zoo, which were failed attempts at understanding various indigenous populations through highly curated public exhibitions of humans in their \u201cnatural\u201d habitat. While standing in their artificial environment, the women are surrounded by pineapples, bananas, and sugarcane - a symbol of agricultural cash crops that are directly related to the political, social and economic upheaval in areas that have long been colonized by Western civilization. \r\n\r\nThrough this exhibition, Tarver questions the authenticity of the current environment which has dramatically changed over time to satisfy contemporary needs. Looking at the present through the lens of the past, Tarver recognizes how the complexities of world history has compounded into modern-day reality and affect how we address our future. \r\n\r\nAbout Adrienne Elise Tarver\r\nAdrienne Elise Tarver is an Atlanta and Brooklyn based artist who received her MFA in Visual Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2011 and her BFA in Painting from Boston University in 2007.

The exhibition takes place January 13 \u2013 February 26 at R & Company\u2019s 64 White Street location on both the lower and upper level galleries and coincides with the launch of the newly released R & Company publication, Wendell Castle: Scrapbook 1958-1980. \r\n\r\nWendell Castle and the \u201cQuiet Revolution\u201d surveys Castle\u2019s most significant early furniture and sculptural works, including several rare pieces being exhibited for the first time this century, juxtaposed alongside sculptures by modern artists and designers who influenced him. On view is a curated collection of fifteen masterworks by Castle made between 1959-80 that demonstrate his most important collectable designs. Highlights include Castle\u2019s 1962 Chest of Drawers made in oak, walnut, birch and oak plywood, his 1967 \u201cBaker\u201d arm chair made in solid stack-laminated oak, his 1980 \u201cMusic Rack\u201d hand sculpted in oak and rosewood, as well as a unique stack-laminated cabinet made in 1975. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe Quiet Revolution,\u201d a reference to Castle\u2019s opening lines in his 1980 publication The Wendell Castle Book of Wood Lamination, serves as a poetic summation of his unrivaled expertise in the field. As Castle stated, \u201cIn the early 1960s a quiet revolution began to take place in the field of woodworking. Simply stated, it involved the gluing together of layers of wood, a process known as lamination.\u201d\r\n\r\nInspired by Castle\u2019s own words alongside reviews and tributes he published in Craft Horizons, the present exhibition juxtaposes works by internationally celebrated artists and designers\u2014Isamu Noguchi, Jean Arp, and Wharton Esherick \u2013as well as lesser-known artists such as the sculptor George Sugarman, whose laminated and polychromed works were the subject of an admiring essay by Castle in 1967.\r\n\r\n\u201cI paid little attention to furniture until 1958 when I discovered Esherick\u2019s work\u2026 It had never occurred to me that furniture could be anything so personal and so powerful as sculpture.\u201d  Wendell Castle penned these words in remembrance of Wharton Esherick for a 1970 essay published in Craft Horizons. It was perhaps the most revealing statement ever written by Castle at the time on the forces behind his transition from pursuing a career as a sculptor to becoming one of America\u2019s most important woodworkers and furniture makers. \r\n\r\nEsherick was not Castle\u2019s only influence. The sculptures of Arp, Brancusi, Calder, Moore, and Noguchi were seen by Castle in publications and museums. Modern design and the history of bent and laminated furniture\u2013from Thonet to Aalto to Eames\u2013were studied closely by Castle as he pursued his own path in the 1960s. This artistic dialogue helped guide Castle toward his greatest contribution to postwar American art: his mastery of the ancient woodworking technique of lamination, and his groundbreaking use of lamination to translate the organic forms of modern art to useful works of furniture. \r\n\r\nA special highlight on view will be the loan of a scrapbook made by Castle\u2019s wife, the artist Nancy Jurs, as a Christmas gift to him in 1980, which traces the fascinating story of Castle\u2019s career and milestones. Jurs and friends of the family collected hundreds of press clippings, photographs, invitations, and personal notes between the years of 1959 and 1980. In the scrapbook, we can read what were, at the time, contemporary local reviews of Castle\u2019s gallery exhibitions and small museum shows; as a result, we can better understand the challenges Castle faced for not following the herd. The ephemera proves that the work created by Castle during this period had a more lasting impression on his field than perhaps he fully recognized.

In this collection of sculptural assemblages, Brooklyn\u2019s trash-toys come together with screws, castings   and plastic paste. Bodily in form, they mirror boats, doll houses, maps, and animals. Each \u201cbody,\u201d intricately detailed, creates curious connections into childhood worlds of imagination, gender, and sex assignment: a femme figure has sea creature skin and a Barbie's Dream House shower between its thighs. An accordion reclines, revealing streamer clad genitals. Ponies prance while t-rex's roar. \r\n\r\nMuch of Foreman\u2019s work is a highly personal examination of gender \u2013 its varying expressions, expectations, and problems. Their work spans multiple media, with past projects exploring the gender fluidity of animals, where the artist depicted their own human body adorned with flamingo feathers, crow feathers, and a unicorn\u2019s head. In one performance, entitled Transplaining, they told their own experience of being trans in plain language while interacting with personal objects like family photos, party decorations, and childhood toys. The relationship between whimsical, child-like aesthetics (similar to the illustrations in a children\u2019s book) and a critical approach to our collective understanding of gender is a common throughline in Foreman\u2019s practice. \r\n\r\nThese themes are continued in I was busy thinkin\u2019 bout toys. Toys are often a child\u2019s first interaction with enforced gender norms. The proliferation of gender specific toys is still prevalent today. Children\u2019s toys are designed to be partly educational with what they normalize. They introduce kids to the kitchen, cars, and fine motor skills. They also introduce kids to performative gender expectations. Toys, however, are also a source of fond nostalgia. They are a reminder of when playtime and magic could be found in cheap plastic. Therefore, Foreman does not shy away from the charm of toys because of their gender-prescriptiveness \u2013 instead, the artist embraces their whimsy full-on by playing with the toys in a way they were not designed to be played with. They have cut apart and mashed together the discarded plastic to make it something better and more beautiful. It doesn\u2019t matter what the toys were expected to do, it only matters what they\u2019re doing right now. \r\n\r\nIvoire Foreman was born in the city of Lisa Frank's factory, in the year pac-man and lincoln logs. In 2007 Ivoire received their BFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - birth place of the pinwheel. In 2015, they moved to the home of mr. potato head and scrabble - New York City. In 2017, Ivoire was awarded their MFA in Fine Art from the School of Visual Arts, NYC. They tinker, play and create in Brooklyn, New York with their spouse, cat and four baby turtles. \r\n\r\nhaul gallery does not rely on artist sales in order to remain operational. we are transparent about our finances. we want to sell work that's not easily sold. we want to reconsider who buys art, other than the extremely wealthy. we want artists to succeed however they define it; sales or no sales.", "artforumID": 181280, "showStart": "2020-01-18T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-16T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17440/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "haul gallery", "galleryDescription": "haul gallery does not rely on artist sales in order to remain operational. we are transparent about our finances. we're in bedstuy, brooklyn", "address": "178 Walworth St.\n1st Floor", "city": "Brooklyn", "zip": "NY 11205", "lng": -73.9541874, "lat": 40.693480413656, "hours": "Sat - Sun 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "haul.gallery", "galleryEmail": "hi@haul.gallery", "phone": "3035183122", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.836Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.836Z"}, {"id": 173, "title": "FEBRUARY LIGHT", "description": null, "artforumID": 181307, "showStart": "2020-01-09T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-29T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17467/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Salon 94 | Bowery", "galleryDescription": "Salon 94 Bowery specializes in contemporary art.

At a time of tension in so many communities around the world, this exhibition is to illustrate how artists deal with the world at its tipping point; how artists find beauty in the darkness of their own times, how they straddle the personal and political in their work, and how they make art as activism.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of an election year in America, amongst numerous international upheavals, and an impending Brexit, we sit at a critical point in time. Songs in the Dark explores the myriad and complex ways in which gallery artists react and respond to the issues and anxieties of today\u2019s reality. Bringing forth dialogue and a heightened perspective on contemporaneity, artists in the exhibition make work that advocates for social justice, community engagement and environmental activism, as a reflection of their own ideas and beliefs.\r\n\r\nAs a woman and mother, Hannah Starkey was inspired by the recent social climate catalyzed by the #MeToo movement, paired with her personal responsibility of raising two teenage daughters, the artist chose to document the 2017 Women\u2019s March in London. The crisp and colorful photographs are filled with protest posters and determined faces, suggesting a dark undertone to the challenges we face.\r\n\r\nFor over a decade, Olafur Eliasson has embodied issues of climate change in his practice and in his life, on both a micro and macro scale. Eliasson believes art has the ability to change our perceptions and perspective on the world and inspire a shared commitment to our planet.\r\n\r\nAs devastating fires in the Amazon pose the threat of deforestation, Ernesto Neto\u2019s work resonates the foreboding effect climate change might have on the individual. With influences from his ongoing collaboration with the Amazonian tribe of the Huni Kuin, Neto creates sensorial environments in which the visitors are encouraged to connect with each other and with the planet at a time when connectivity is most needed. For Neto, sculpture is an extension of the body, and the body is ultimately an extension of earth. His 2019 work Delight Us is designed as a healing bed, where people can connect to themselves, to nature and to one another.\r\n\r\nMeschac Gaba\u2019s Memoriale aux Refugies Noyees - Memorial for Drowned Refugees, is a solemn monument to profound loss.  Based on an old Beninese ritual performed when someone drowns at sea, this work speaks to the global refugee crisis and the thousands of people who have perished during dangerous sea crossings. Highlighting the vulnerable status of migrants and refugees, who are often decried as economic burdens rather than viewed as victims of unspeakable circumstance, Gaba\u2019s work uses very few formal means to produce the mute melancholy of memory and to invite compassion.\r\n\r\nEntitled Last Meals on Death Row, Matt Collishaw\u2019s still life series depicts the last meals requested by Texas inmates on death row. Using dramatic baroque lighting, these works are based on 17th century Dutch still life paintings or \"nature morte\u201d. These sad vignettes present a cruel irony - meals offered as sustenance at the moment of extinction. Each of these memorials for the incarcerated elicit a human connection as we are faced with the morality of capital punishment.\r\n\r\nUsing a wide variety of strategies Mark Dion\u2019s work explores how dominant ideologies shape our perception of knowledge. The historically significant Bureau of Censorship, presents an office for an imagined small town censor. The interior is furnished with a variety of accouterments, including an expansive library of forbidden titles that were censored and outlawed in America throughout the 20th century. Within our current political climate, where free speech and personal choice are under siege, this work is rendered more relevant than ever.\r\n\r\nRivane Neuenschwander\u2019s Watchword is a large-scale interactive work that contemplates personal proclamation. Here viewers are invited to engage with an abstracted version of the world map using words and phrases provided by the artist. The texts are embroidered on swatches of fabric that can be pinned to the map or to the viewer\u2019s own clothes. These individual texts are strung together to create slogans of protest, phrases that can be personal or public, general or specific.\r\n\r\nOn a personal level, Gillian Wearing\u2019s film Bully is presented in the upstairs gallery space. Confronting the viewer with an individual's catharsis of sorts, this powerful video traces the experience of being a victim, bystander or bully. We follow the construction of fiction as it transcends one character's personal story to become a reality for all participants. In a revelatory moment, the victim is able to confront his bully and begin to heal the emotional damage he has endured.\r\n\r\nImagining a future of hope, Tom\u00e1s Saraceno models and proposes new sustainable ways of how we might live in the clouds. Resounding in gentle orbit, Saraceno\u2019s sculptures question our role in the ecological crisis and how we might envision our future on this planet.\r\n\r\nSongs in the Dark offers a wide variety of perspectives, through which the artists in the exhibition reflect on the concerns and commonalities that inform our time. For now, more than ever, there is an urgency to build on these ideas and encourage thoughts as a vehicle for action.\r\n\r\nArtists in the exhibition: Phil Collins, Mat Collishaw, Mark Dion, Olafur Eliasson, Meschac Gaba, J\u00f3nsi, Agnieszka Kurant, Charles Long, Ernesto Neto,Rivane Neuenschwander, Lisa Oppenheim, Susan Philipsz, Analia Saban, Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, Slavs and Tatars, Hannah Starkey, Gillian Wearing.", "artforumID": 181324, "showStart": "2020-01-11T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-20T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17484/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Tanya Bonakdar Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Tanya Bonakdar Gallery specializes in contemporary art.

As we understand it now, vernacular is the broad framework in which self-taught, outsider, folk, and \u201cprimitive\u201d art occur. It encompasses the full spectrum of art making by, of, and for \u201cthe people;\u201d all those creating on the margins of the academy. It relates differently (or not at all) to art historical narratives, to the waves of influence and rupture, and holds itself accountable only to the aesthetic sensibility and psychic compulsions of its makers. \r\nVernacular Woman presents depictions of women in several mediums (paintings, works on paper, and sculpture) by self-taught, outsider, and anonymous artists active in the United States between the late 18th century and the present year. We understand \u201cwoman\u201d here as a visual idea; a familiar archetypal form, but also as a fluid concept that becomes richer and more nuanced with each distinct portrayal. As a collective, the women represented here tell an intriguing, open-ended story that bridges the ordinary with the uncanny and the frankly histrionic. The works in this exhibition are conventional, taboo, raw, sophisticated, disturbing, playful, beautiful, bizarre, perverse, hermetic, transparent... They speak to us with a sincerity, and a vitality, that comes from being unaware and unafraid of rules and expectations. \r\nIn a pair of drawings, respectively dated 1852 and 1853, Edward Durnford\u2014a military man otherwise anonymous\u2014rendered two likenesses of \u201cJulia\u201d at different moments in their presumed courtship. This is woman as wife, delicately recreated in graphite and blue colored pencil before photography transformed portraiture. Other representations of secular women include two needle prick watercolors found in New Orleans that could have been made as early as 1790, each presenting a figure standing in Little-Prince-like isolation, dressed in hybrid garbs illustrative of the African, French, and Caribbean cultural m\u00e9lange of a southern city after the Revolutionary War; two works by Bill Traylor, women in motion\u2014surely seized from the streets of Montgomery on a busy day between 1939 and 1942\u2014and a female horse rider by Mart\u00edn Ram\u00edrez (1954), smiling from her mysterious architectural stage like a memory captured in technicolor, her stallion's hoofs matching her yellow pants, her red spurs echoing the linear iterations blushing around her. William Edmondson\u2019s Lady with Cape (1935-40), one of the artist\u2019s occasional earthly subjects, a kind of totemic female masterfully chiseled with minimal intervention on a chunk of limestone, is achieved with the same restraint as a small 1950s anonymous painted sculpture of a woman half immersed in water, emerging flawlessly from a solid block of wood that becomes a bathtub in a dance between illusion and abstraction. \r\nDesire, sexual fixation, voyeurism, and pure fantasy permeate a number of works in this exhibition. An \u201cerotic\u201d cane (New England, mid to late 19th or early 20th century), guides the viewer through its unembellished shaft to focus on the carved handle: an upturned female figure in suspended motion designed to accommodate a hand ergonomically between her open legs. The Snake Dancer, a painting by Louis Michel Eilshemius from around 1915, presents us with a Dionysian can-can dancer holding a snake (their gazes locked with one another) against a backdrop of witchy green flames. Woman and Spider (1936), an oil on canvas by William Fellini, depicts a woman both thrilled and terrified to find a big black spider climbing up her bed. Morris Hirshfield\u2019s Harp Girl II (1945) and Nude with Vase (1946)\u2014a woman \u201csailing\u201d a harp-boat and a standing nude next to a large neoclassical vase overflowing with ferns\u2014both exude a gentle hypnotic sensuality pulsating throughout the woven patterns, textures, and theatrical \u201cprops\u201d that were so vital to the artist\u2019s vision. Gustave Klumpp presents us with a fantasy forest landscape of mixed perspective and scale (1971-72) that revolves around a woman, between a Venus and a bride, in a sheer white gossamer gown reclining on a hammock\u2014her breasts and genitalia gratuitously exposed, shown from above for the viewer\u2019s pleasure. Morton Bartlett photographed a nude inanimate girl-woman in lifelike manner (1950-60) whose preadolescent body he molded out of plaster around a wire skeleton. Bartlett\u2019s game of make-believe was twice removed from reality, familiar and eerie in equal measures.\r\nAnother faction of artists regard woman as a classic muse and subject of unbridled fascination. A carving in giltwood and ebonized pine found in New England (early 20th century) portrays a nude female standing religiously still\u2014the milky iridescence of her bare skin emphasized with an internal deco frame. Another carving depicts a kind of river nymph (1920-30) contemplating a butterfly resting on her right hand, and a sculptural torso of a bare breasted Hindu goddess (1925-35) observes the world with her immutable jeweled third eye. Helen Rae\u2019s works on paper (2019) transform the spreads in fashion editorials into whole new worlds of collapsed three-dimensionality and vigorous color planes that convey a kind of drunkenness on beauty, wherever it may be found. Thornton Dial\u2019s and Mary T Smith\u2019s fluid, intuitive image-making transforms woman into semi-abstract matter. His works on paper and her paintings occurred in quick gestural fits. In Dial\u2019s case, women are seen as sinuous, erotic beings (often transmigrating to fish and birds) for whom he expressed a physical and psychological curiosity. Smith\u2019s works make us witness to an intensely personal spiritual journey where she recreates herself and those around her in bold animated brushstrokes.\r\nRole-playing, alter egos, and performativity conclude this story. Lee Godie staged many photographic photobooth self-portraits (made between 1970 and 1994) in which she assumed different personas\u2014the \u201cFrench Impressionist\u201d central among them\u2014with the help of costumes, props, and face paint. She also often further altered her image by scratching or coloring over the surface of the prints. Edward Lawson\u2019s drawings portray what seems to be a man in women\u2019s clothing, perhaps Lawson himself, in glamorous dresses, elaborate coiffures, and dramatic makeup. Renaldo Kuhler feminized himself as \"Renelda\" Kuhler, a journalist for the New York Times who traveled frequently to Rocaterrania, a country of the artist\u2019s invention, to report on the nation's politics and culture. Kuhler conceived Rocaterrania as an autobiography and illustrated it for more than 60 years. His feminine doppelg\u00e4nger is one of the more literal clues revealing that all the inhabitants of this nation\u2014men, women, and neutants (asexual beings)\u2014embody various facets of the artist, whose gender fluidity informed his vastly imaginative creation. Ursula Barnes\u2019s I Cannot Choose (1930-40) is conceivably the most perplexing work in this exhibition, a melodramatic pastiche; part amateur painting, part German expressionist, and part circus banner. Like a Florine Stettheimer scene on crack, two clownish characters (a woman who could be a man and a man who could be a woman) occupy a kitschy exterior (or what could be a theatrical interior) heavily ornamented with Chagall-esque florals. The woman is surrounded by three jovial fluffy dogs and four puppies, the man holds a bouquet and looks at her expectantly, his red smiling lips a kind of counterpoint to her complacent pout. There\u2019s an outrageous, mesmerizing \u201cwrongness\u201d here that\u2019s somehow right.\r\n***\r\nThe Museum of Modern Art was a pioneer in the presentation of vernacular art, in no small part due to Alfred H. Barr Jr., the museum\u2019s young founding director, and the early involvement of the legendary collector, and later art dealer, Sidney Janis\u2014who was invited to join the advisory board of the museum in 1934. Barr\u2019s trailblazing vision of self-taught art as one of the three foundations of modern art\u2014along with cubism and abstract art, dada and surrealism\u2014and Janis\u2019s passionate advocacy of American art\u2014from abstract expressionism and pop to self-taught art\u2014resulted in some of the most exciting exhibitions the museum has ever mounted. Among them, a one-person Edmondson show of sculpture in 1937 (the first in history by a self-taught, African American artist), Contemporary Unknown American Painters in 1939 (which introduced sixteen self-taught artists), and an unprecedented retrospective of work by Hirshfield in 1943, then a recently retired cloak, suit, and slipper manufac\u00acturer who had only started making art six years prior. Janis published the first comprehensive examination of self-taught art in the book They Taught Themselves (1942) with a foreword written by Barr, and through his own gallery, founded in 1948, he conceived the model for what we now call \u201ccrossover:\u201d showing and promoting then emerging artists such as Pollock, de Kooning, and Warhol, and self-taught masters (Rousseau, Hirshfield, Kane, Pippin, Pickett) alongside European master works.\r\nThe now widely acknowledged paradox is that vernacular artists thrust mainstream art into modernity, inspiring what would become the avant-garde to forget their schooling so they could access the truest source of their own creativity. To this extent, we can agree that vernacular art comes from a more primal place, that it is different, and\u2014most importantly\u2014that the antagonism between high and low culture is false. Ricco/Maresca, picking up the baton of Barr\u2019s and Janis\u2019s legacy, continues to convey these beliefs. We define vernacular categories to better grasp how they can ultimately be surpassed, but also to understand how they relate to the full picture: like the dark side of the moon or the deep sea; generally invisible, still largely uncharted, but truly inextricable from the whole. \r\n\r\n-Alejandra Russi", "artforumID": 181341, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-07T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17501/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Morris Hirshfield. &#8220;Nude with Vase,&#8221; 1946.

Sashie\u2019s work revolves around the belief that the coacervate is a universal model and basis for all systems and organisms, simple and complex. Since producing his very first works, Alberto Di Fabio has been taking inspiration from the world of natural sciences such as biology, chemistry and astronomy.

This exhibition pulls together three artists whose practices weave through shape, figurative abstraction, and gallows humour. These distinct voices explore an amalgam of archetypes through visual story-telling and material compositions. The host of characters in this work blend into an overarching motif of the jester and the idea of the painting as a riddle. Rehearsed as a backwards journey, the mental gymnastics of the comedic alchemist transforms tragedy into entertainment and sadness into laughter.\r\n\r\nDan Rizzo-Orr\u2019s latest body of work utilizes kites as a picture plane and a conceptual jumping off point for abstract compositions. Filled with multiple haunting eyes, Rizzo-Orr\u2019s collaged works resemble a school of asymmetrical snake-like creatures bound by the edges of the canvas. In Edward Salas\u2019 colorful paintings, clowns and cowboys meld into convalescent characters with a phantasmagoric spectral presence. His work employs conventions of religious iconography infused with visual narratives pulled from Latin American folklore. Working with encaustic wax on birch panel, Seneca Weintraut will exhibit new works presenting characters that resemble a traveling hobo troubadour or grizzly man. In his studio process, the artist imagines a non-linear timeline, negating the Western ideology of a one directional arrow of time.\r\n\r\nDan Rizzo-Orr\r\nDan Rizzo-Orr (b.1989) is a Chicago-based artist. He was born in Phoenix, AZ and holds a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His recent exhibitions include 4th Ward Project Space (Chicago), Bar 4000 (Chicago), Andrew Rafacz Gallery (Chicago), LVL 3 (Chicago), and H.G.

Using collected images from Western film and fashion magazines, photographs from family albums, as well as portraits of himself with other gay men, Xu enacts a deeply intimate and political performance.\r\n\r\nXu was raised in a conservative home in a military-housing complex in Beijing, where expressions of overt non-heteronormative behavior were discouraged. With very limited exposure to the LGBTQ community in China, he understood his sexuality through Western culture, particularly film, television and fashion, which were dominated by representations of white, masculine men, under the overarching notion of the American Dream. Now living in the United States, Xu traveled back to Beijing to activate these installations in secret while his parents were away. And through the recontextualization of images and the revisiting of his own personal history, Xu provides a poignant cross-cultural examination into oppressive systems of power. \r\n\r\nLayered and visually complex, the photographs skew the architecture of the apartment, reconstructing each space into a dense mosaic of revealing and self-referential imagery. There are photographs taped to the ceiling, draped across furniture, covering windows and doorways, curled, layered and protruding at odd angles. Prints of nude men burst from luggage or are seen secreted in a drawer; cartoon decorations celebrating the Year of the Dog mix with images of the American flag and a Pacific sunset. For Xu, the project examines this intersectional experience as a foreign, Asian, gay man in the United States, while redefining his home as a queer space that finally acknowledges him.\r\n\r\nGuanyu Xu (b. 1993, Beijing) lives and works in Chicago. He earned his MFA from the Art Institute of Chicago in 2019 and is the winner of the Foam Talent, LensCulture Emerging Talent and Kodak Film Photo Awards. In 2020, examples from Temporarily Censored Home will be featured in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the New Orleans Museum of Art; as well as solo exhibitions at the Philadelphia Photo Arts Center and The College of East Asian Studies Gallery at Wesleyan University.

The prolific British artist, musician, and writer has produced hundreds of albums and dozens of volumes of fiction and poetry. For his fifth exhibition with the gallery Childish has created a body of work emblematic of his \u201cradical traditionalist\u201d approach. Pulling from themes found throughout art history\u2014the bather, a lone figure in a landscape, a sunset\u2014Childish presents intensely personal vignettes that feel archetypical, vibrating with the kinetic energy of a moment lived. The gallery will host an opening reception on Thursday, January 23, from 6 to 8 PM at 536 West 22nd Street.\r\n\r\nWhile working in a state of flow is essential to the creative process of any artist, for Childish this state represents the entirety of artistic production. Working intuitively and quickly, most of his highly gestural paintings are created in a single session without any revision. Childish is also an adept woodblock printer and he produces satirical and activist imagery with his London art cooperative, L-13 Light Industrial Workshop. His material approach to printmaking extends to Childish\u2019s painting practice where color and line are emphasized through a flattening of each composition. His style is often compared to the expressionist painters of the early 20th century, such as Vincent Van Gogh, Kurt Schwitters, or Edvard Munch, however, for Childish, it is the embodiment of these artists\u2019 roles within society that is most compelling. An unabashed universalist, Childish considers artistry to be the inheritance of every human being, a method to capture the expressive impulse and visualize the powerful lure of beauty.\r\n\r\nUtterly unironic and vividly familiar, a Childish painting can be interpreted the way one might interpret a dream. In one painting, a woman swimming underwater may represent the unconscious, while in another painting, a woman wading out to a cave could represent the dark entry into the unknown. For the artist, the conceptual should never replace the humanistic\u2014Childish states \u201cI make a picture in the same way a child does\u2014something \u2018out there\u2019 interests me. Making a painting of that \u2018something\u2019 then joins me with the universal creator/creation in a more intent way than just being an observer.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout the artist\r\nBilly Childish (b. 1959, Chatham, Kent, United Kingdom; lives and works in Whitstable, Kent) attended Medway College of Design, Kent in 1977 and Saint Martin\u2019s School of Art, London in 1978. Solo exhibitions of his work have been organized at Rochester Art Gallery, Kent, United Kingdom (2016); Opelvillen R\u00fcsselsheim, Frankfurt, Germany (2016); White Columns, New York (2010); and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, United Kingdom (2010).

REMASTER is an iteration of the artist\u2019s ongoing cinematic adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s novel, The Master and Margarita (written 1928-40). Her project is guided by one of the central principles offered by the novel: the existing infrastructure of this world must be used to create a new one. Since 2008, Haiduk\u2019s exhibitions have doubled as filmmaking studios for REMASTER. Here, the made world becomes a cast of living things, full of agency and the desire to act upon their surroundings. In anticipation of the next phase of this project, two levels of SI have been transformed into scenes from Bulgakov\u2019s novel: the Variety Theater on the ground floor and Apartment 50 on the second floor.\r\n\r\nMikhail Bulgakov (b. 1891 in Kiev, d. 1940 in Moscow) called The Master and Margarita his \u201csunset novel,\u201d and it was left unfinished at the time of his death. One of its main protagonists is a majestic and strangely benevolent Satan figure named Woland, who arrives in Soviet Moscow describing himself as \u201can artiste,\u201d \u201ca professor,\u201d and \u201ca consultant,\u201d and quickly reveals a politically darkening world unto itself. The novel valorizes examples of courage and love, however messily they appear, and is unsparing towards cowardice, seeking to reattach consequences to actions.\r\n\r\nHaiduk\u2019s scenography for REMASTER is infused with her own distinctive aesthetics. Glittering surfaces, velvet furnishings, bright flowers, and shifting light conditions create a seductive environment containing fragments of spells and hidden designs. The sound of a cat\u2019s purr reverberates around the galleries with both comfort and threat.\r\n\r\nThe theater space on the ground floor draws on the Balkan cabaret tradition, and in line with the conspiratorial spirit of this underground commons, 500 keys to its locked entrance will be distributed during a ceremony at REMASTER\u2019s opening reception on January 16. Inside the theater, a program renders a film without images. Entitled Lunar Interval VI (2020), it features Woland\u2019s black magic act, which sets the stakes for a life without imagination.\r\n\r\nThe second floor conjures the apartment where the heroine, Margarita, and Woland enter into a transaction to save the life of Master, the novel\u2019s archetypal artist. Prior to the conclusion of Haiduk\u2019s exhibition, inside this precisely furnished place, two new scenes will be recorded before a live audience.\r\n\r\nOn several evenings, REMASTER plays host to collaborative performances, cabaret nights, musical events and improvisations. In this way, the exhibition can also be considered as a studio where new work is made.", "artforumID": 181614, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-22T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17774/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": " Irena Haiduk, Remaster: Bullitt Working, image for Swiss Institute, 2019, produced by Yugoexport.", "gallery": "Swiss Institute / CONTEMPORARY ART", "galleryDescription": "Swiss Institute specializes in contemporary art.

When is something a powerful intuitive skill or just a bad habit? How do we differentiate between needs and desires? Have you ever eaten a word, a placebo, a memory or with your eyes closed?

Void & Co. operates in the borderland between artistic and curatorial practice; orchestrating collaborations with other artists, partners and art institutions. The word void contains several connotations. It is a space that is empty, a place not yet filled, a gap or a vacuum. It can also mean a feeling of emptiness and loneliness; a feeling that something is missing. In its original form, the \u201cvoid\u201d may not be something to covet, but in this gap, there is enormous potential. A potential to fill out the yet unfilled with content and make sense. With their projects, Void & Co. tries to fill the void with stories that are missing in one way or another.\r\n\r\nThis program is supported, in part, by the Joseph Robert Foundation, the Albers Foundation and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council.

Katherine Bradford, Ryan McGinley and Jack Pierson all have eloquent roots buoyantly grounded in the carefree landscapes of summer, commenting on its meditative quality, its essence and its energy. We are thrilled to have each of them returning to participate in this exhibition.\r\n\r\nJack Pierson sets the tone of Dog Days with a sculptural text piece that is reminiscent of a lolling mantra one would exhale while settling into a well-deserved respite on a lazy summer afternoon.  Adding a chorus of tranquility, Katherine Bradford\u2019s paintings are rich in playful, lush hues depicting citizens-of-summer exerting various levels of carefree energy; some floating, some diving, some just possibly out strolling\u2026 then posing momentarily to be captured by the viewer.\r\n\r\nRyan McGinley\u2019s photographs lean towards the more adventurous and rambunctious side of summer fun, yet can also be relaxed and contemplative. Each work radiates with aspects of the vitality of youth, companionship (human and animal) and the verdant backdrop of the sprawling stage of summer.\r\n\r\nAs the organizer of this exhibition, I have wonderful memories of each of these artists from summering in Provincetown. I\u2019ve frolicked along the beaches with Jack, sailed with Ryan and Jack, and saw my first exhibition of Katherine\u2019s at a wonderful gallery in the back room of Tim\u2019s Books. It is indeed a thrill to have the three of them exhibiting in our gallery with, as Katherine puts it \u201cworks smelling of the sea\u201d and of summer.\r\n\r\n- Tim Donovan\r\n\r\nKatherine Bradford is a contemporary American artist known for her luminous paintings which merge abstraction with representational motifs. Referencing outer space, Superman, Albert Pinkham Ryder\u2019s nocturnal paintings, and the glowing colors of Mark Rothko, Bradford builds up her surfaces in thin washes that absorb and emanate light with an eerie beauty.  Born in 1942 in New York, NY, she attended Bryn Mawr College and later received her MFA from SUNY Purchase. The artist currently divides her time between Brooklyn, NY and Brunswick, ME. Today, Bradford\u2019s works are held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Smith College Museum in Maine, the Worcester Museum of Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, among others.\r\n\r\nRyan McGinley was born on October 17, 1977, in Ramsey, New Jersey. He received a BFA in graphic design at Parsons School of Design, New York, in 2000. That same year he staged his first solo show of photographs, The Kids Are Alright, inside an abandoned warehouse in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood. He sent his self-published catalogue of the exhibition to curators, artists, and magazine editors he admired, and it garnered attention from Sylvia Wolf, a curator of photography at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Wolf championed his work, and in 2003, at 25 years of age, McGinley had an exhibition as part of the museum\u2019s First Exposure series, making him the youngest artist ever to have a solo show at the institution.\r\n\r\nMcGinley has had solo exhibitions at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1), New York (2004); Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo de Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain (2005); Foam Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam (2007); Ratio 3, San Francisco (2010, 2013); and the Daelim Museum, Seoul (2013\u201314). Group exhibitions include those at Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (2004); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2007); Brooklyn Museum (2009\u201310); and Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2010). McGinley lives and works in New York.\r\n\r\nJack Pierson was born in 1960 in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston in 1984.

Working in pencil, watercolor, egg tempera and his much-beloved personal medium of drybrush, Wyeth, throughout his life, was a resolute champion of the universal life force of each person he chose to paint, and of the unique, difficult, ever-changing rural American world in which he chose to live.  His art was controversial as it was popular, and he remains one of very few living artists to be celebrated by important single-person exhibitions at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1976) and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (1987).  Andrew Wyeth\u2019s 1966-67 exhibition, at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art in Philadelphia, the Art Institute of Chicago and New York\u2019s Whitney Museum of American Art, was one of the best-attended museum exhibitions in history. \r\n\r\nThe young Andrew Wyeth grew up in a prominent artistic family.  His father, Newell Conyers Wyeth, was an important illustrator and realist painter and a strong, early influence on his fifth child, Andrew.  The family lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania (population 3600), in Delaware County about 25 miles southwest of Philadelphia and summered in Cushing, Maine in the rural midcoast area.  Andrew, who began by emulating his father, making illustrations, soon eschewed illustration and instead chose the people and familiar landscape of his surroundings as the subjects that would endure throughout his life.  \r\n\r\nBeginning in about 1940, Andrew Wyeth portrayed his closest neighbors.  His iconic Christina\u2019s World, painted at the Olson farm in Maine, depicts Christina Olson, disabled from the waist down, whom Wyeth had seen dragging herself across a Maine field.  Christina\u2019s World (1948), purchased by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, for $1,800., brought Andrew Wyeth to great prominence which continues to this day.  But perhaps his most characteristic works of this period and through about 1970 are landscapes that imply personal struggle and depict quintessential American beauty. Firewood (Study for Groundhog Day) (1959), Riverboat (1963), and Maine Door (1970), all in the Forum Gallery exhibition, are examples.\r\nAlthough Andrew Wyeth had begun to paint provocative female nude subjects in 1945, it was in the early 1970\u2019s that he began an extraordinary, 15-year, artist/model relationship with his Pennsylvania neighbor, Helga Testorf that resulted in more than 240 works, nearly all completed in secrecy and not shown or exhibited until 1986.  Two of these works, Letting Her Hair Down (1972) and In the Orchard (1974) are in the Forum Gallery exhibition.  The Helga paintings were controversial for many reasons, but may well be the most insightful, sensitive and beautiful figurative works Andrew Wyeth completed.  \r\nIn the 1980\u2019s, Andrew Wyeth produced fully mature and developed landscapes and figure paintings, and the Forum Gallery exhibition includes Anchor Man (1983), The Blonde Study (1985) and Housebound Study (1986). \r\nIn the 1990\u2019s, his involvement with his chosen models at an end, Andrew Wyeth returned to his neighboring landscapes as his subjects, imbuing each work with a personal and poetic vision, inspiring the viewer to provide a narrative, an identification with the focus the Artist brought.  In Jimmy\u2019s Porch (1991), East Point Lighthouse (1991) and Pickup Sticks (1994), all included in the Forum exhibition, Andrew Wyeth again showed why his unique and highly personal art transcended realism and Americana while incorporating both, and became one of the most celebrated artists of the Century.  \r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nForum Gallery is located at 475 Park Avenue at 57th Street, New York, NY 10022.

Working with a specially designed easel in a square format, De Oude creates densely patterned and vibrantly colored compositions that seem to radiate and glow from within. An adjustable guide on the easel allows him to carefully measure and vary the spaces between the color lines while also enabling him to skew them diagonally in certain works. De Oude varies the width of the color bands through his choice of brushes and modulates their transparency and opacity using careful color mixtures and varying densities of application. Because of their precision and optical vibrancy, his paintings are frequently mistaken by viewers to be computer generated but they are carefully and patiently crafted by hand.  \r\n \r\nWhile De Oude begins his paintings with certain color choices in mind, his process is open-ended and has no predetermined result. As the works progress, additional colors are intuitively selected as overlapping lines build up. Structured bands of colors are used to create subtle transitions of atmospheric light as the eye travels from side to side, top to bottom, or from corner to corner across the paintings. A number of the panels have been subdivided into four or nine equal sections. In these works, De Oude creates rhythmic patterns with the progression of gradient light and the illusion of changing depth and volume. In other paintings, light bursts outward from the center or slowly recedes into a deep space.\r\n \r\nRob de Oude (b. 1970, Den Helder, Netherlands) studied painting, sculpture, and art history at the Hoge School voor de Kunsten in Amsterdam and attended graduate school at SUNY Purchase, NY.

Transforming and elevating common items into works of art, this show recognizes ordinary dignity and random delightfulness. \r\nBrad Nelson\u2019s paintings of mostly packaging materials and the resin cast everyday objects by Mark Power are an immersion in the pleasures of the popular and a meditation on the daily grind. \r\n\r\nBrad Nelson paints in his living room, instead of a space reserved strictly for art making, in an effort to make painting feel more seamlessly intertwined with his life. He is interested in exploring how a daily ritual or rhythm can bring him things that are at times outside his sphere of control and yet can also be the driving force behind what he chooses to make. The artist finds his subject matter in what comes to him serendipitously: the cardboard packaging from a yogurt maker, bed-linen packaging, or an old clip-top storage container that used to store hand-me-down shoes for his youngest daughter. Still-life painting is a perfect fit since its history is irrevocably tied to the portrayal of the less important wares of domestic life. Nelson chooses to examine the ubiquity, design elegance, and unintentionality of the ephemera that deliver what\u2019s important. \r\n\r\nMark Power\u2019s typically monochromatic sculptures are life-size and exact replicas of the real objects. The artist is interested in the use of words, and how our identification with them as they exist as objects can be compromised and challenged, redirected from the clinical and antiseptic to a feeling of emotion, time and intimacy. Power transforms anonymous utilitarian everyday objects such as paper plates or sneakers into unique works of art, re-contextualized by material, surface and quantity. The logic, and eventual location of this \"source material\u201d, versus the venues they were cultivated from, create a dynamic that the artist works in and from. \r\nPower\u2019s interest in John Cage\u2019s work already gave him a vocabulary for the unobserved/unnoticed; making the decision to select profoundly simple unimportant yet at time useful objects seem to carry that message farther.\r\n\r\nFalmouth, MA based Brad Nelson received a Bachelors degree in photography from the University of Kentucky, Post Baccalaureate Certificate, School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and an M.F.A. in Painting and Drawing from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/ Tufts University.\r\nMark Power lives and works in New York.

For the last two decades, the Austrian artist has redefined the ways we understand and look at absurdity in his sculptural, performative, and engaging works. For this exhibition, Wurm will combine biological effects to create a new series that pushes the boundaries of sculpture even further. There will be an opening reception for the artist on Thursday, January 16 from 6 to 8 pm.\r\n\r\nFeatured in the exhibition is a work from Wurm\u2019s now-iconic One Minute Sculpture series, which highlights the artist\u2019s interest in the absurdity that can be found in mundane scenarios of daily life&#8213;a theme that was the focus of Wurm\u2019s presentation for the Austrian Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale. For a full minute, audience members actively become a part of the work, as choreographed by the artist. Underlying this physical engagement is a commentary on gallery-goers\u2019 attention span as well as the importance of a viewer\u2019s engagement with works of art as a necessary agent for their completion.\r\n\r\nBuilding on this body of work, Wurm has produced a series of One Minute Forever sculptures, where he has substituted the active human body with acrylic versions. Here he incorporates fruits or books held \u201cforever\u201d by disembodied legs and hands, and in one work a torso resembling a Greek sculpture with a chair precariously resting on its shoulder. All of these white-painted sculptures belie a ritualized process that is characteristic of Wurm\u2019s practice where form is abstracted and becomes absurd, thus creating a new sense of realism.\r\n\r\nAlso on view in this exhibition, Wurm\u2019s Bar series deploys found furniture such as a sidebar, a table, or a commode, bisected by a larger-than-life size pickle or potato-shaped white sculpture. The entire work is then used as a bar. Wurm's disruption of both the original function and organic form of the mid-century modern furniture he employs is an engaging visual social commentary on the preciousness of art objects, antique furniture, and the ways in which we interact with our surroundings. The sculptures become emblematic of a wider history and social class&#8213;more specifically that of his native Austria\u2019s 700-year-long monarchy&#8213;through the lens of design, manipulated and shaped by the artist.\r\n\r\nDistortion of forms is further explored in Wurm\u2019s Dissolution series, where body parts such as a belly button appear embedded in a sculpture abstracted to the point that new organic forms emerge, seeming both familiar and alien to the viewer. The Self-Portrait sculptures are works that the artist shaped using the imprint of his knee onto clay and combined with everyday objects such as a broom, a plunger, or tennis balls. As the title of this body of work indicates, here the artist is reflecting himself in different everyday, mundane roles. These sculptures, as well as Wurm\u2019s practice more broadly, are portraits of society that offer an implicit social critique of contemporary culture, emphasizing the banality of the everyday and challenging and extending the possibilities of sculpture.\r\n\r\nAbout the artist\r\nErwin Wurm (b. 1954 Bruck an der Mur/Styria, Austria; lives and works in Vienna and Limberg, Austria) graduated from University of Graz, Austria, in 1977, and Gestaltungslehre University of Applied Art and Academy of Fine Art, Vienna in 1982. Recent solo exhibitions of his work have been organized at Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Contemporain, Marseille (2019), Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Marseille (2019), Mus\u00e9e Cantini, Marseille (2019), Vieille Charit\u00e9, Marseille (2019), Vancouver Art Gallery (2019), Albertina Museum, Vienna (2018); Storage by HyundaiCard, Seoul (2018); 21er Haus, Belvedere, Vienna (2017); Museum K\u00fcppersm\u00fchle f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Duisburg, Germany (2017); Leopold Museum, Vienna (2017); Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (2017); Berlinische Galerie, Berlin (2016); Schindler House, MAK Center for Art and Architecture, West Hollywood, CA (2016); Bangkok Art and Culture Center, Thailand (2016); Indianapolis Museum of Art, IN (2015); Museum of Contemporary Art in Krak\u00f3w, Poland (2013); Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo de M\u00e1laga, Spain (2012); and Dallas Contemporary, TX (2012).

Entitled Democracy Portraits, the exhibition will run from 16 January through 22 February 2020. The gallery is located at 83 Grand Street, cross streets Greene and Wooster, on the ground floor. A second solo exhibition, made up of works from the same series, will run concurrently at ASHES/ASHES at 56 Eldridge Street, cross streets Hester and Canal, on the ground floor. \r\n\r\nIn the years since the 2016 election, Michael St. John has been making paintings of identical format and widely varying subject matter, media, and medium as part of his \u201cDemocracy\u201d series. This body of work manifests themes of documentary long central to St. John\u2019s practice, filtering culturally significant and insignificant flotsam to aggregate an American iconography well-versed in prosaic violence. The impulse to collect and record is reflected in the artist\u2019s active chronicle of the revolving door of news and history, a sustained accounting of cruelty and indifference as filtered through the impulse-buy products and magazines of a CVS checkout line. Democracy, as rendered in this series of paintings, is not reduced to a cynical indictment of plutocratic winner-take-all politics, but a complex, panoramic, and evolving national portrait as pictured from the margins.\r\n\r\nIn an essay on the artist, Christian Rattemeyer contextualizes his work in relation to Richard Hofstadter\u2019s term \u201cthe paranoid style,\u201d \u201can encompassing philosophy of exceptionalism and moral absolutism laced with violence, sexual energy, and renegade redemption. [It] reared its head at a time when St. John was coming of age\u2013during a period of genuine social change and unrest, the civil rights movement, and political assassinations.\u201d This background is accompanied by a deep engagement on St. John\u2019s part with the Ashcan school and legacies of Pop art. Working from this standpoint, his American portraits frequently center on those surviving on the slimmest of margins and wrung for the vastest of profits. His choice of materials always carries with it questions of class, value, and waste, subject matter filtered through the dross of mass culture; yellow press and bargain bin ephemera built for quick turnover and routine consumption. Rather than resulting from repeated acts of appropriation, St. John\u2019s work can be understood as directly coextensive with infinite streams of publicity and media. This process reflects a broader cultural change, a mediatization of reality wherein, as Niklas Luhmann describes it, \u201cthe observation of events throughout society now occurs almost at the same time as the events themselves\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn a truly representative form, \u201cDemocracy\u201d accounts for the good, bad, and ugly, acknowledging the influence of both Anna Wintour and Tony Soprano in the cultural pantheon. The project does not attempt an encyclopedic accounting, and the gaps between St. John\u2019s \u201centries\u201d prove among the most evocative and disquieting aspects of the series read as a whole. Alongside Pok\u00e9mon Go and Colonel Sanders, art historical references figure into many works. Tapping into the timeless melancholy of F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres\u2019 \u201cUntitled (Perfect Lovers),\u201d St. John\u2019s \u201cDemocracy (September Eleventh)\u201d is a spare and aching painting of two analog clocks whose hour and minute hands record the moments the twin towers were struck, rendering the matter-of-fact and the unutterable.\r\n\r\nTrompe l\u2019oeil is a recurring trope throughout the artist\u2019s practice, often employed directly alongside collaged material to collide fiction and non-fiction. Their competing and overlapping presence describes the central role of mimesis within his work, with imitation and the thing itself positioned as discrete but not mutually exclusive means of representation. St. John\u2019s efficient and deft faculty as a painter is equaled by the masterfully stark formal reduction with which he isolates and strips bare symbols and imagery. The exposed and blunt charge of his paintings is disarmingly forthright; without the mediation of context, the latent and violent ideologies embedded in the material are laid bare and made confrontational.\r\n\r\nSt. John has shown his work extensively over the past thirty years in museums, alternative spaces and galleries throughout the United States. Although he\u2019s known primarily for his four exhibitions at the Andrea Rosen Gallery, other notable shows include those at Karma, Marlborough Contemporary, Edward Cella in LA, CCS Bard, The Rubell Family Collection, The Weatherspoon Art Museum, Andrew Kreps and Feature Inc.. This is the artist\u2019s third solo show at Team, having shown here previously in 1998 and 1999.\r\n\r\nTeam is open from Tuesday through Saturday, 10am to 6pm.

The presentation will consist of 14 wall-mounted sculptures produced from 2017 through 2019 in a variety of materials, including zinc, aluminum and paper and the debut of a new installation piece comprised of 49 vertical wooden columns with slices removed in Gebhardt\u2019s usual serial fashion that explore various permutations of cuts and orientations on different faces, each placed on the floor in an array. The new floor piece can be arranged in many different permutations to make a site-specific intervention that is unique to each space. The wood planks are also sold individually. The exhibition will be on view from January 26 - February 21, 2020 at David Richard Gallery located at 211 East 121 Street, New York, New York 10035, P: 212-882-1705.\r\n \r\nGebhardt is known for his minimalist sculptures that he has been producing since the early 1970s. This particular presentation highlights current and new works and focuses on his ongoing exploration of space, or better yet, voids. He uses diverse materials, including paper, steel, zinc, aluminum, wood and rocks and always a minimal color palette of white, black, grey or the natural surfaces of various metal supports.\r\n \r\nHis works are organized in series to examine multiple permutations of a particular theme. As noted, in the case of the new work consisting of 49 wooden elements, each comprised of a vertical wood column with cuts and voids at various angles, spacing and repetitions. The columns are then arranged in linear arrays as floor pieces in rows at right angles to each other with wide spaces between each to facilitate the viewer\u2019s engagement by walking in and around the installation from different angles. The different permutations between each column creates unique and different views depending upon the viewer\u2019s position, ambient light and other visual information in the space.\r\n \r\nThe wall sculptures with their angled cuts and undulations from the various materials, resulting from them being hung from a cleat and thus giving the appearance of floating on the wall, also nod to the notion of illusory space. The subtle use of voids, the color black, slices and cutaways in the support materials at extreme angles can be interpreted as optical and illusory, reminiscent of the works by the members of the Park Place Gallery in the 1960s in lower Manhattan. Gebhardt creates an internal tension within his wall sculptures that successfully suggests the possibility of a three-dimensional structure in a two-dimensional plane. Thus, the subtle illusory effect.\r\n \r\nThe reductive and minimal aesthetic with an austere appearance and clean surfaces provides a serene and meditative calm in Gebhardt\u2019s work. As a result, the subtle serial permutations and clean lines invokes contemplation and a subconscious desire to decode the permutations for possible patterns and clues as to the origins and/or meaning.\r\n \r\nAbout Roland Gebhardt:\r\n \r\nRoland Gebhardt was born in Paramaribo, Suriname 1939. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich and earned a Master of Fine Arts at the Art Academy of Hamburg. He is a sculptor working in a variety of media and exhibits internationally. Probably best known for his large-scale environmental sculptures that explore the concept of \u201clinear volume\u201d and presented at Wave Hill and Storm King, both in New York in the early 1970s. Another important body of work was his examination of \u201chost volumes\u201d using a range of natural materials, including boulders, fruit and vegetables in a critically acclaimed series of eight single day presentations in 1982 at the Kunstmuseum, Duesseldorf.\r\n\r\nMoving into a more conceptual realm, Gebhardt explored the complex subject of individual and group identity by leveraging sculpture and creating a series of masks to produce, \u201cThe Only Tribe\u201d, a multi-media performance work at the 3LD Art & Technology Center in New York City in December of 2008. The theme of identity was further explored by incorporating dance with sculptural masks in 2013 at Storm King Art Center and on the grounds of the Chautauqua Institution. \"Trophies\", a further iteration incorporating music explored identity and the transformation from a living being to a hunter\u2019s trophy.\r\n\r\nGebhardt\u2019s works are in the permanent collections of numerous museums and public collections, including: the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Storm King Art Center, Mountainville, NY; Neuberger Museum, State University of New York, Purchase, NY; Brandeis University, Waltham, MA; Kunstsammlung of the City of Ludwigshafen, Germany; Wave Hill, Center for Environmental Studies, Bronx, NY;  among others as well as many corporate and private collections.\r\n\r\nAbout David Richard Gallery:\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 2010, David Richard Gallery has produced museum quality exhibitions that feature Post War abstraction in the US. The presentations have addressed specific decades and geographies as well as certain movements and tendencies. While the gallery has long been recognized as an important proponent of post-1960s abstraction\u2014including both the influential pioneers as well as a younger generation of practitioners in this field\u2014 in keeping with this spirit of nurture and development the gallery also presents established artists who embrace more gestural and representational approaches to the making of art as well as young emerging artists.\r\n \r\nIn 2015 David Richard Gallery launched DR Art Projects to provide a platform for artists of all stripes\u2014international, national, local, emerging and established\u2014to present special solo projects or to participate in unique collaborations or thematic exhibitions. The goal is to offer a fresh look at contemporary art practice from a broad spectrum of artists and presentations. The Gallery opened its current location in New York in 2017.\r\n \r\nAll Artwork Copyright \u00a9 Roland Gebhardt, Courtesy David Richard Gallery.\r\n \r\nFor additional information please contact:\r\nDavid Eichholtz, Manager\r\nMobile: 917-853-8161\r\nD@DavidRichardGallery.com", "artforumID": 181654, "showStart": "2020-01-26T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-21T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17814/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Roland Gebhardt - New Work - Floor and Wall Sculptures", "gallery": "David Richard Gallery", "galleryDescription": "David Richard Gallery is located in the New York and specializes in post-war abstract art including Abstract Expressionism.", "address": "211 East 121st Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10035", "lng": -73.9370446, "lat": 40.801077513708, "hours": "Tue - Fri 12pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "davidrichardgallery.com", "galleryEmail": "info@davidrichardgallery.com", "phone": "2128821705", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.856Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.856Z"}, {"id": 231, "title": "Red", "description": null, "artforumID": 181820, "showStart": "2020-01-30T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-07T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17980/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Beverly Semmes, Slip, 2019, Ink, acrylic over photograph printed on canvas, 72 1/2 x 50 in.", "gallery": "Susan Inglett Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Susan Inglett Gallery specializes in contemporary art.

This is Rouillard\u2019s third solo exhibition with the gallery.\r\n\r\nIn concert with his paintings, Rouillard\u2019s drawings, scrolls and tape pieces share a critical part of his studio practice and provide a greater look into the artist\u2019s processes and meditations. The exhibition offers an overview of Rouillard\u2019s discipline over the last decade - including single and multi-panel oil on aluminum paintings, ballpoint pen pieces on paper and tape, as well as preliminary drawings for the paintings. The recent body of work continues Rouillard\u2019s interest in the framing of light. \r\n\r\nRegarding the paintings and scribble pieces, the artist has written: \u2014I am interested in working with subtle distinctions of perception closely related to the architecture of a space. The compositions are made of intersecting lines and bands with the joints between panels becoming an element in the composition - another way of making a line. Although on aluminum they are perceived as being physically very light, almost as if on paper. Their clarity is not unlike print on a page or musical notation where a strong contrast between black and white makes possible the thinnest of lines.\r\n\r\n \u2014The ink pieces started in 1993 with the simple act of scribbling with a ball-point pen in a 14 x 11\" sketch pad (soon after, 4 pens in each hand were used). In order to treat the entire surface evenly, the pad was rotated every so often then flipped to do the same thing to the reverse. They are worked on until darkened to a dense satin black (until line melds into plane). The process is initially hidden - seen but unseen.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, Rouillard has been involved with the creation of a subtle tension between the slightly elongated square of the overall piece and the stronger horizontal elements in the composition. Although grid-based, he works intuitively with proportion, dimensions, and composition. \r\n\r\nHe began the multi-panel pieces in 2016 with several triptychs and in the past 2 years has done 9, 12 and 18 panel pieces - one of which will be included in the present exhibition. His initial focus of working within the confines of a given rectangle has developed into a horizontal expansiveness.\r\n\r\nRouillard lives and works in New York.", "artforumID": 181208, "showStart": "2020-01-10T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-16T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17368/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Michael Rouillard, 18 PANEL PIECE, 2019 (DETAIL), oil on aluminum, 32 x 558 in", "gallery": "Pablo's Birthday", "galleryDescription": "Pablo's Birthday specializes in contemporary art.

Opening on January 23, 2020, at 509 West 27th Street, the presentation brings together 12 large-scale works realized in bronze, wood, and stone. Responding to the architecture of the gallery, Allen demonstrates unprecedented ambition in the works\u2019 scale. Included in the exhibition is his tallest sculpture to date\u2014a bronze measuring approximately 16 feet at its highest point. A career-spanning monograph published by Rizzoli Electa and organized by Kasmin and Blum & Poe, who also represent the artist, will include text from Douglas Fogle and Glenn Adamson, and is due for publication in Spring 2020.\r\n\r\nPsychologically charged and compulsively expressive, Alma Allen\u2019s works evoke a curiosity regarding the life of objects and the ways in which form and material can circumnavigate the utility of language. Known for his distillation of diverse organic references, the artist\u2019s works simultaneously invite and resist classification.\r\n\r\nOften realized in materials hand-selected from quarries or foraged from landscapes in the area surrounding his studio, the works emit a mysterious and ineffable life-force. The abstracted, biomorphic shapes feel talismanic not only in their atmospheric qualities but also by way of their playfulness: bronze sculptures appear impossibly malleable, even liquid; wood grain patterns are accented to highlight their material history, and stones such as peach onyx, pale green cantera, and obsidian vibrate with a sense of mysticism. Whichever medium Allen chooses, the works\u2019 final forms and their particular outcrops and eccentricities are conjured by the artist during their making, born of a wordless conversation between sculptor and object.\r\n\r\nThe artist\u2019s hybrid process encompasses preindustrial methods of hand-shaping and carving alongside advanced 21st-century technology. After repeatedly reworking finger scale clay maquettes, Allen will employ, as needed, a self-built robotic device for translation into large-scale works, finished with an impeccable softness that belies their weight and density. A bronze foundry, constructed in the artist\u2019s studio in Tepoztl\u00e1n, Mexico, enables Allen to complete works on site.

The word \u201cassembly\u201d is defined as the action of fitting together the component parts of a machine or other object; a group of people congregated together in one place for a common purpose; or the action of gathering together for a universal goal.  This exhibition has been inspired by this word and this action, bringing together three artists working within unique mediums, challenging the typical notions of painting and sculpture.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnergized by a recent residency in Santiago Chile, Damien Davis\u2019 new works take their influence from various points in Chile\u2019s history, attempting to form a confluence of historical reference points.  Constructed from plexi-glass and stainless steel hardware on panel, these works expand upon his practice of unpacking the visual language of cultures both domestic and abroad, questioning how cultures code and decode representations of \u201cblackness\u201d in its myriad of interpretations.  With the recent protests in Chile heavily influencing numerous protests here in the United States, these works build a connecting bridge, linking the two countries\u2019 shared histories of national expansion, governmental turmoil, and political activism. \r\n\r\nRachel Eulena Williams\u2019 sculptural paintings continue an experimental approach to painting\u2019s materials.  For this exhibition, Williams uses traditional painting panels as pedestals, in the fashion a sculptor would use a pedestal to hold an object.  These panels contain cut, sewn and painted canvas.  These new structures allow drawing and mark making to come from the physicality of the objects and their relationship to paint.  Willams\u2019 works confront the form of abstract image by incorporating sculptural techniques. Often employing rope, transforming its nature, she creates relief marks; a history of moving objects are made across the surface in this newly defined  process of painting.  Williams\u2019 works are fundamentally a study of memory, looking at how the life of the object, the individual, and tradition cohere into a worldview, questioning the relationship between perception and reality.\r\n\r\nSun You\u2019s work overlaps the spheres of fine art, craft and home decoration.  The artist\u2019s abstract wall panels are both paintings and low relief sculptures. The association with domesticity and baking is reinforced in her handbuilding techniques of rolling, pinching polymer clay and firing the works in an oven.  The included tabletop sculptures loosely reference Ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement. Within these sculptures she utilizes objects such as eyelash extensions, razor blades, beads, screws and earrings.  In combining these materials the artist references \u201cwomen\u2019s work,\u201d craft, the ready made and the language of abstraction. These works draw beauty and humor from humble materials and is a reflection on the joy, pathos and fragility of daily existence.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition will be on view from January 25 - March 21, 2020.  For available works, press inquiries, and additional information, please contact hello@mrsgallery.com.\r\n\r\nDamien Davis (b. 1984), holds a BFA in Studio Art and an MA in Visual Arts Administration from New York University.  His works have appeared at The Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Arts and Design, New York, NY and various galleries across the country. He is the recipient of the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Community Engagement Grant and has been awarded residencies with Triangle Arts Association, the Museum of Arts and Design, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Pilchuck Glass School and Sugar Hill Children\u2019s Museum of Art and Storytelling. Davis is currently an artist in residence Dieu Donn\u00e9 Paper Mill in Brooklyn, NY.  He is also a former fellow and current advisor for the Art & Law Program in New York.  Davis lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\nRachel Eulena Williams (b. 1991, Miami, FL) received a BFA from Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York in 2013. Her work has been exhibited at Night Gallery, Los Angeles, SomeTime Salon, San Francisco, CA; Ceysson & B\u00e9n\u00e9ti\u00e8re, Derek Eller Gallery, The Journal Gallery, New York; Greenpoint Hill, Brooklyn; Halsey Mckay Gallery, East Hampton, New York; Mass Gallery, Austin, TX; and Ceysson & B\u00e9n\u00e9ti\u00e8re, Wandhaff, Luxembourg.

Happening: An Arturo Vega Project is pleased to present Jane Dickson\u2019s Hot, Hot, Hot, a series of rarely seen and moody paintings of Times Square peep shows from the 1980s. Dickson\u2019s history and legacy are rooted in Times Square. She worked and lived there from 1978 to 2008 documenting her daily lived experiences and observations as a young woman. In photos, drawings, and paintings that utilize unconventional industrial and domestic materials as surfaces\u2014including carpet, sandpaper, and black plastic bags\u2014she captured a time and place that was notoriously lawless, squalid, and vibrantly alive.\r\n\r\nIn her essay for the exhibition catalog, art historian Deborah Frizzell places Dickson as a critical witness and commentator on the effects of mass media on \u201cperception and desire\u201d:\r\n\r\nRooted in the street as a site for public intervention, as a place to seek out alternative stories and ways of being, Dickson works with the existing repertory of cultural imagery and reveals the slippage or difference prompted in the interplay of power and illusion in contemporary America, particularly from a feminist perspective that has been ignored and erased from view. Rather than a smoothly polished verisimilitude or a crafted collage of fragments, Dickson\u2019s rough-cut method often disorients, jars our senses, and doubles the vertigo induced by obliquely angled perspectives or alternatively, flattened peepholes and cubicles.\r\n\r\nWhile the specifics of live peep shows flaunting the broad spectrum of unenhanced bodies accepted in a pre-cosmetic-surgery era are now exotic, and the live peeps are a historic artifact of the pre-internet universe, the underlying dynamics of power and vulnerability and the stark divide between who works and who pays remain as relevant as ever.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition follows the success of the Anthology Press monograph Jane Dickson in Times Square, published in 2019; the exhibition All That Is Solid Melts into Air at James Fuentes Gallery; and the Whitney Museum\u2019s purchase of Dobbs Hats, one of her key early Times Square paintings. To further contextualize her work, the exhibition includes a fully illustrated catalog with essays by Sara Rosen, Deborah Frizzell, Carlo McCormick, and David Kiehl.\r\n\r\nA part of the politically charged 80s scene of artists working at the intersection of street art, hip hop, film, and installation\u2014like David Wojnarowicz, Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, and her filmmaker husband Charlie Ahearn\u2014Dickson was a member of the influential artist collectives Colab (Collaborative Projects) and Fashion Moda in the South Bronx. She was one of the organizers of the now legendary Times Square Show, for which she created the poster with Charlie Ahearn and a and digital animation that ran hourly on the Spectacolor sign at 1 Times Square, the first computerized lightboard in New York. This groundbreaking digital installation led Dickson to initiate the Messages to the Public series in 1981 with the Public Art Fund, presenting a series of animated artworks on the billboards of Times Square and bringing first public attention to her friends Keith Haring, Jenny Holzer, David Hammons, and Crash among others.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 Dickson created City Maze, an installation designed for school children at Fashion Moda, the art space in the South Bronx founded by Stefan Eins, which became a platform for the burgeoning hip-hop and graffiti movements. https://youtu.be/OmN4f2_Lmvc\r\n\r\nBeyond Times Square, Dickson\u2019s focus has encompassed other facets of the contemporary architecture of distraction: demolition derbies, carnivals, casinos, strip malls, and highways, utilizing industrial materials such as AstroTurf, sandpaper, vinyl, and felt, for both their tactile qualities and their associations.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Dickson created a beloved series of 68 life-size mosaic figures of New Year\u2019s Eve revelers installed in the Times Square subway station. Dickson\u2019s work has been widely exhibited nationally and internationally, and is included in the collections of more than 30 museums including The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art. In 2016, The National Portrait Gallery\u2013Smithsonian Institution acquired her portrait of Fab 5 Freddy from 1983, where it is currently on display.

Her portrait process happens organically as models go through her wardrobe, accessories and props to discover a \u2018persona\u2019.  These \u2018play-dates\u2019 serve as a pivotal ingredient for her practice as they are the underpinning of the subsequent photoshoot that serves as the source material for her paintings.  Referencing this initial imagery, Lewis explores celebrated cultural forces such as the Lone Ranger, high school cheering squads, home-court basketball, yearbook superlatives, track shorts, tube socks and tennis headbands which feature in the work. \r\n\t\t\t\t    \r\nLewis\u2019 collaborative approach documents a consciousness of place, playfulness and self-awareness framed by irreverence and raw candor that she is known for.  Her compositions portray coming-of-age empowerment, authenticity, spontaneity and informality expressing an entirely new story; one that is intentionally left open-ended, allowing for a timeless resonance.  Lewis\u2019 cleverness of interweaving modernity and past pop-cultural phenomena renders imagery that comments on society\u2019s evolving perceptions of youth, girl culture, beauty, identity,\u00a0teen trends, empowerment, social issues\u00a0and pop culture.  The paintings play with scale, redefine gender stereotypes and revisit past decades with a dose of satirical zing that results in trophy toting portraiture and willful non-conformist debutantes gone rebel-rogue.  \r\n\r\nTara Lewis earned her BA in Painting and Printmaking at the University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH and her MA in Visual Studios and Art Education at Tufts University and The Museum School in Boston, MA. Lewis has spent over a decade\u00a0as a Professor\u00a0and Chair of the Department of\u00a0Art\u00a0at\u00a0Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, NH. Her artwork has been included in exhibitions and events at the Aspen Art Museum, Aspen, CO, The Watermill Center, Watermill, NY, Chelsea Art Museum, New York, NY, New York Fashion Week and is held in private collections in Palm Beach, New York, London, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.  Lewis has been featured in publications such as Whitewall Magazine, New York Magazine, Elle, Vice, Artnet, Art + Auction, and Cultured Magazine among others, and was recently published in RxArt\u2019s\u00a0Between the Lines, Volume 7: Contemporary Artist Coloring Book. \r\n\r\nLewis\u00a0designs and prints her own\u00a0text idioms onto wearable objects such as satin pageant sashes, t-shirts, trophies and ping pong paddles, which she considers unique limited-edition print objects.\u00a0These objects convey messages, re-examine stereotypes & explore timeless youth\u00a0culture and serve as a trampoline for her paintings. The\u00a0interaction of word & image is central to her work. Lewis is a direct descendant of Art Nouveau artist Alphonse Mucha, one of her primary influences, who also infused typefaces and cultural portraiture into his celebrated and pivotal compositions. The artist lives and works in New York City.\r\n\r\nFor further information, contact:\r\n\r\nLyons Wier Gallery\r\n542 West 24th Street, New York, NY 10011\r\nTel: +1 212 242 6220 / Email: gallery@lyonswiergallery.com \r\nwww.lyonswiergallery.com\r\n#lyonswiergallery @lyonswiergallery", "artforumID": 181827, "showStart": "2020-01-30T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17987/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Tara Lewis, Hell Yes, 2019, Oil on canvas, 60 x 46 in / 152 x 117 cm", "gallery": "Lyons Wier Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Lyons Wier Gallery is the premier Representational gallery in New York City specializing in Conceptual Realism.", "address": "542 West 24th Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10011", "lng": -74.0058266, "lat": 40.749048813683, "hours": "Tue - Sat 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "lyonswiergallery.com", "galleryEmail": "gallery@lyonswiergallery.com", "phone": "+12122426220", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.858Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.858Z"}, {"id": 237, "title": "DOGS and BONES", "description": "Theodore:Art is pleased to present DOGS and BONES , an exhibition of work that contemplates the potential for psyche and soul in our animal companions and ourselves, through life and after-life. Bringing together art and fashion star Scooter LaForge, the Manchester-based social media phenomenon Faye Scott-Farrington, and obsessive collage artist Nancy Handler from Florida, DOGS and BONES aims for laughs, tears, shivers, pathos, and visual riches.\r\n\r\nCanine visitors are welcome on Sunday afternoons.\r\n\r\nFaye Scott-Farrington\u2019s collages began by using the dogs from women's weekly magazines, \u201creal life\u201d publications purport to show real people going through real trauma, joy, love and drama as a proxy for humans, transforming suffering into a bland consumable, reality TV-type rubbernecking. In time the canines in her work have also begun to hint at the possibility of an inner life in these companion animals.\r\n\r\nFaye Scott-Farrington is a Greater Manchester based artist working in a variety of media, her work is tongue in cheek and often reasonably obscene. She studied at Manchester Metropolitan University for both a BTEC foundation art and BA(Hons) interactive arts and later gained an Open Degree with art history at the Open University. She also spends an unreasonable amount of time in the company of dogs.\r\n\r\nNancy Handler incorporates collaged elements from all kinds of books and periodicals, illustration, and painting to create diminutive works of both kitsch and horror. Decay and dissolution of the body and its historical environs, are suggested in bright appealing flower-strewn tableaux, suggesting the specter of death and destruction that belies the living world, like Ophelia\u2019s corpse in a beautiful forestial clearing.\r\n\r\nNancy Handler has a BFA from the University of Michigan and an MFA from Pratt Institute, as well as a post-graduate Educational Specialist degree in photography from Florida International University. After working in the fashion world for some time, Handler returned to her art practice, as well as teaching for Dade County Public Schools and as an adjunct for Miami-Dade College and the International Fine Arts College. She has shown her work in numerous group shows in Miami and New York. Handler lives and works in Miami.\r\n\r\nScooter LaForge (b. Las Cruces, New Mexico) is a New York-based artist who has lived in the East Village for the past 18 years. His unique style mines the catalog of art history by infusing classical themes with a colorful sensibility. LaForge works in various media, including painting, sculpture, and drawing, and employs unorthodox techniques and striking iconic images.

The show, comprising a group of graphite portraits on found cardboard, will be on view from January 24th through March 8th, 2020. What's Up Fam? marks Kunle Martins' first solo presentation with 56 HENRY.\r\n\r\nLooking at the portraits that artist Kunle Martins creates of his loved ones, I observe the wanness of double-tapping quick approval on a friend\u2019s face in a newsfeed. It really is the limpest gesture of love we can muster, isn\u2019t it? Certainly as compared to the slow and meticulous study visible in Martins\u2019 work\u2014in the indexical smudges of graphite on (to quote the artist) \u201cAbused White Cardboard\u201d found usually behind a Costco. These materials are readily available to all, and Kunle\u2019s works gently suggest that I might connect with a bit more intention to what is already all around me. \r\n\r\nIs there anything that defines our lives more than our relationships with others (via their bodies, their spirits, their words, their art)? I can think of no greater influence on my own; and as I age, I grow ever more fascinated with the profound gift that is longterm relationship. When you can push further and further alongside someone else, the discoveries are manifold and expansive, bringing with them tears of relief in understanding. \r\n\r\nKunle's continued dedication to portraiture sets him apart; he has drawn his friends and lovers in unbroken accumulation for twenty years - like the On Kawara of crackling, interpersonal bonds. Kunle left his biological family home at only sixteen years old, and his portraits belie an investigation of identity not guided by the inherent lens of the self, but via a potent exchange of subjectivity between himself and those intimate with him. In lovingly interpreting and processing the image of a friend\u2019s face through his own mind and body, he reveals not only his perception of the sitter but the grace of being himself known by that person. Where many of us at sixteen might be mired in a forced tangle of self-definition, Kunle\u2019s teenage self seemed to instinctively understand that \u201cindividual identity\u201d in itself has no meaning. Without receivers or mirrored subjectivities to behold, impact, and relate to, individual subjectivity becomes the proverbial tree falling in the forest. When working at its best, the self is a bead of dew held to a web of love. \r\n\r\nSo in these portraits, we not only see the faces of artists, skaters, musicians, and filmmakers but also the interconnected identity of Kunle himself: his bonded nature, his caring eye, his humble yet monumental investments, and the endless gifts he receives in kind. This is culture! Let\u2019s not forsake it!\r\n\r\n-Blair Hansen\r\n\r\nKunle F. Martins was born in 1980, in New York, NY where he currently lives and works. Known for the past two decades as Earsnot, Martins was a founding member of the infamous IRAK crew, a group of New York graffiti artists. His work has been the subject of numerous presentations both stateside and abroad, including a solo show at Shoot The Lobster (New York) and group shows at The Hole (New York), Beyond the Streets (New York), White Columns Benefit Auction (New York), Amelchenko (New York), Jeffrey Stark (New York), Bonnie Poon (Paris), Coney Art Walls (New York), Wynwood Walls (Miami), Los Angeles MoCA, and Clayton Patterson Gallery (New York).\r\n\r\nFor further information about the exhibition, please contact the gallery at info@56henry.nyc, or +1 (518) 966-2622.", "artforumID": 181961, "showStart": "2020-01-24T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-08T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18121/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "56 Henry", "galleryDescription": "56 Henry specializes in contemporary art.

Staged in collaboration with the Destina Foundation, Collages will be on view from January 23, 2020, at the gallery\u2019s 297 Tenth Avenue location. The exhibition features approximately forty collages on paper, ranging in both scale and subject matter, and spanning 1920 to 1975. Many of the works, with a focus on the 1960s and 70s, have never before been exhibited.\r\n\r\nAccording to art historian Werner Spies, nearly everything in Ernst\u2019s oeuvre can be traced back to collage. Bringing the fracture and disassociation of post-World War I existentialism into pictorial form, collage complements Ernst\u2019s equally novel adoption of frottage and assemblage. The uniquely illusionistic quality and contextual depth of Ernst\u2019s collages speak to his ability to seamlessly create new realities formed upon the Dada and Surrealist tenets of poetry, imagination, and dream.\r\n\r\nUsing source materials that include illustrations, periodicals, catalogs, newspapers, and scientific journals, these collages are often further altered using painting and drawing. They reveal fundamental aspects of Ernst\u2019s art-making\u2014the uncanny juxtaposition of unassociated forms and images. The exhibition consists of early works such as Loplop pr\u00e9sente Loplop (1931), a superb example of Ernst\u2019s use of indirect self-portraiture through his alter ego Loplop, who appears for the first time during the early 1930s and recurs throughout his oeuvre. Loplop is recognizable by his division into head, showcard, and feet, and calls to mind the structure of the cadavre exquis, the exquisite corpse.\r\n\r\nA selection of collaged lettrines, or drop-caps, created by Ernst primarily for inclusion in artist books, are a focal point of the exhibition and demonstrate the artist\u2019s range and fluidity of style within the medium of collage. Originating in European medieval illustrated manuscripts, lettrines acted to introduce a decorative flourish to the text and to indicate the beginning of a new chapter. In Lettrine D (1948) the forking branches of a tree intersect with an eel and a prehistoric winged creature to form the body of a Frankensteinian figure that frames the capital D. This particular lettrine was made for inclusion in a limited-edition catalogue designed by Ernst and published on the occasion of his 1949 retrospective at the Copley Galleries in Beverly Hills.\r\n\r\nEight of the works on display were originally presented at Alexander Iolas\u2019 Paris gallery in 1971, the same year in which Max Ernst celebrated his eightieth birthday. Titled Lieux Communs, the exhibition featured twelve original collages and eleven poems by Ernst, highlighting his aptitude as an artist of both images and words. The collages and poems were also published as a limited edition print portfolio. Lieux communs translates directly to \u201ctruisms,\u201d or more generally to \u201cbanalities,\u201d or \u201ctrivialities,\u201d reflecting the quotidian nature of the imagery selected by Ernst. Utilizing repeating patterns and dense cross-hatching, the artist folds the curvilinear shapes of the natural world\u2014including animals such as Loplop\u2014into scenes defined by the geometric structures of both classical and modern architecture. His composition of intimate domestic interiors, household objects, and indicators of bourgeoisie living are subtly unsettling. For example, Les Filles La Mort Le Diable (1970), translated as \u201cGirls, Death, and the Devil,\u201d can be demarcated into three vertical columns. Whilst at first glance the contents signal legibility, on closer inspection, it is clear that they misalign: the world has been rearranged by Ernst.\r\n\r\nAs articulated by Werner Spies, \u201cCollage is the thread that runs through all of his works; it is the foundation on which his lifework is built. Once we have realized this, Max Ernst takes on the stature of an artist who opened the collage process\u2014the combining of existing visual material\u2014to possibilities that completely transformed its meaning, both technically and ideologically.\u201d\r\n\r\nKasmin would like to thank Timothy Baum and Dr. Ju&#776;rgen Pech for their considerable contribution to the research and preparation of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nMax Ernst (1891\u20131976) was a German painter, sculptor, poet, and printmaker celebrated as one of the primary pioneers of Dada and Surrealism. Working in Europe during the heyday of Modernism, and in the US from 1941 to 1953, Ernst developed a style that melds metaphor, mythology, and memory, and draws upon the depths of the irrational and unconscious mind. His masterful illusionistic techniques and uncanny juxtapositions transform impossible compositions into unsettling realities. Whilst the menacing atmosphere of both world wars loom large in his work, Ernst's oeuvre is more accurately defined by an abundant life-force born out of a combination of the fanciful logic of dreams, the recurring and dynamic presence of animals, and Ernst\u2019s enduring biting humor.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact: + 1 212 563 4474 | info@kasmingallery.com\r\nFor press inquiries, please contact: Molly Taylor | molly@kasmingallery.com", "artforumID": 181248, "showStart": "2020-01-23T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-29T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17408/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Max Ernst, &#8220;Untitled,&#8221; 1970, gouache and paper collage on paper, 7 x 5 1/2 inches, 17.8 x 14 cm. \u00a9 2020 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ADAGP, Paris, France.", "gallery": "Kasmin | 297 Tenth Avenue", "galleryDescription": "Kasmin specializes in contemporary art.

The song unapologetically criticizes the Generals\u2019 repressive government with powerful, metaphorical lyrics. Although the song was immediately censored by General M\u00e9dici\u2019s regime, it became the anthem for millions of Brazilians of all ages.

Despite various attempts to deter them, artists in Brazil have long stood up against dictatorship, authoritarianism, and censorship, and have fought for a civil and just society for many generations. In this spirit, the twenty-four contemporary artists in Samba In The Dark channel the energy of widespread activism that continues to thrive in Brazil. The works exhibited span several decades and encompass a wide variety of materials.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA group of drawings by S\u00e9rgio Sister serves as a foundation for this show. They were made while Sister was imprisoned and tortured in Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s, and take on an unsettling urgency today as the tentacles of the old military regime are threatening contemporary society again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShaped by this history, old and young artists alike feel inclined toward experimentation and allegorical plasticity while solidly standing in a long history of Brazilian art.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYes, we do, after all, have a reputation for being a Samba dancing, ass-shaking nation. Samba is rooted in our culture and in our lives, and vibrant colors define our landscape.

This will mark the artist\u2019s inaugural solo exhibition.\r\n\r\n\u201cMa\u201d or &#38291; is a common Japanese word with no specific English equivalent. It can be universally understood as a pause. It is an absence that defines a space, the interior of a bowl. \u201cMa\u201d is more of an interlude than it is a chasm. One\u2019s understanding of \u201cma\u201d is driven by her shifting perception as she becomes acquainted with a given setting.\r\n\r\nKuwayama wants to engage this term in a new body of work that includes plaster paintings and site-specific installation of varying mediums. Non-toxic materiality is central to her practice, and nearly every element of her work is handmade: she forages berries or crushes charcoal for pigment, paints with a milk compound, can name the sheep from which she produces her own yarn. Her mindful harnessing of mediums connects Kuwayama\u2019s artistic practice to all other realms of her days. Her creative decisions, for example, affect the world her children inhabit, the world we all inhabit. She expressed that she works through \u201ca process of compression and expansion\u201d where \u201clife spills into art and art spills into life.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis tendency to scrap compartmentalization is intentional. Kuwayama operates without regard for linear or received narratives often visible in art history. The work she\u2019s installed in the gallery, therefore, develops and commands white walls as well as peculiar structural elements in order to highlight in-between spaces. &#38291; (Ma) summons us into these interstitial moments of art, so that we challenge our senses to engage with the real as much as the imagined, the created and the approaching.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in the gallery for the opening reception of &#38291; (Ma) on Saturday, February 1st, from 6:00\u201310:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nTo schedule a press preview, please contact Claire Foussard, claire@kismithgallery.com.\r\n\r\nSono Kuwayama (b. 1963) is a visual artist working with installation through painting, sculpture and video. She finds fluidity in working between various disciplines that allows her the freedom to create without limitations.

Pilsen is considered to be one of the last large cities to be liberated, which happened on May 6, 1945.\r\n\r\nThe advancement od Allied troops, their disembarkment in Normandy, the battle of Ardennes - all of these events are captured in the beginning of this exhibition, which was transported from the Patton Memorial Pilsen Museum and tailored to the needs of the spaces of the Czech Center New York Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition will present to the public the events which had direct impact on Pilsen patriots in Czechoslovakia, more precisely in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, for example the assassination of the Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich or the events connected with the war-time production in the \u0160koda factory, and their roles in the repeated air strikes carried out by the Allies. \r\n\r\nThe visitor will find out more not only about the liberation of Pilsen itself, but also of the whole Pilsen region, and will also be introduced to the history of the Third United States Army under command of General George Patton, which brought freedom and peace to the region. They will be reminded of the activities of General Harmon and post-war aid to Czechoslovakia by the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).\r\n\r\nThe final part of the exhibition is first represented by the dark years of 1948 - 1989, when the communist regime was determined to erase this part of history from people's minds. With the November revolution then came the first celebrations of the liberation in 1990, together with the return of the liberators and their memories.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition includes a map of the advancement of Ally forces through Europe, from the beaches of Normandy to Pilsen.", "artforumID": 182029, "showStart": "2020-01-29T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-01T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18189/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Czech Center New York", "galleryDescription": "Czech Cultural Institute in New York City.

The exhibition marks the U.S. premiere of her new film Archive (2019), and the world-premiere of Ruins (2020). Related works, the audio track Hydriotaphia (2016), and the series of photogravures, Shadow Archive (2019), will also be on view.  \r\n\r\nTo create Archive, Tan conducted extensive research on the Belgian visionary and peace activist Paul Otlet (1868\u20131944). Otlet\u2019s Mundaneum, also known as the \u201cpaper Google,\u201d encompassed an ambitious plan to catalogue all human knowledge in the hope of achieving world peace. In Archive, we wander within the interior of the fictional architecture Tan designed to house Otlet\u2019s utopian archive. But like his deteriorating papers and documents, Tan\u2019s futuristic, circular structure is already desolate and falling to ruin. Filmed inside a virtual 3-D full-scale model, Archive is meticulously constructed entirely from computer-generated imagery and is the artist\u2019s first foray into this technology.\r\n\r\nRuins, a two-screen projection created using both 16 mm analogue film and high definition digital video features imagery filmed on location in an abandoned mining complex at the Grand-Hornu in Belgium, a World Heritage site and ruin in itself. \u201cInside a ruin,\u201d says Tan, \u201cI feel as though I can glimpse time in motion. I am witness to a drawn-out collapse that is taking place before my very eyes in agonizingly slow motion. A ruin simultaneously shows me a building\u2019s past, present, and future. I see time moving forwards and backward as if on film.\u201d In her translation of these two opposing languages, Ruins traces parallels between her architectural subject-matter and the media at-hand, questioning the future of both analog and digital moving image. \r\n\r\nThe artist book, Fiona Tan: A Walk Among Ruins, published on the occasion of the exhibition, includes an essay Tan wrote while working on her latest installation Ruins. The two-volume monograph Fiona Tan: L\u2019Archive des ombres / Shadow Archive (2019) is also available. \r\n\r\nFiona Tan, who is based in Amsterdam, has attracted international recognition for her film and video projects since the end of the 1990s. Oscillating between documentation and fiction, biography and imagination, Tan\u2019s work is informed by her acknowledgment of the camera as an agent provocateur, rather than an instrument for recording reality. Deeply embedded in all of Tan\u2019s work is her fascination with the deceptive nature of representation and the play of memory across time and space. \r\n\r\nRecent solo exhibitions include Sprengel Museum, Hannover (2019); Museum Ludwig, Cologne (2019); MAC\u2019s Grand-Hornu, Belgium (2019); De Pont Museum, the Netherlands (2017); Tel Aviv Museum of Art (2017); MMK, Frankfurt (2016), Mudam, Luxembourg (2016); Guggenheim, Bilbao (2016); Izu Photo Museum, Japan (2016); The Baltic, United Kingdom (2015); Nasjonalmuseet, Oslo (2015); the Philadelphia Museum of Art (2013); MAXXI, Rome (2013). In New York, her work has been included in group exhibitions and screenings at the Museum of Modern Art, the New Museum, ICP, and Film Forum. Tan represented the Netherlands at the 53rd Venice Biennale with her solo presentation Disorient (2009). Major public collections include the Tate Modern, London; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; National Galerie, Berlin; New Museum, New York; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; among others.  \r\n\r\nA reception for the artist will be held Thursday 9 January, from 6 to 8 pm.

Heap of Bird\u2019s inaugural exhibition with the gallery asserts Native American sovereignty,\r\nunderscoring the relationship between the body, land, and ownership.\r\nLocation is an intrinsic component to Heap of Birds\u2019 work. Upon entering the exhibition, one is confronted with the history of the land upon which one stands. Indigenous people are comprised of about one thousand nations but are often viewed as a singular race. Heap of Birds, whose roots are tied to the Cheyenne and Arapaho nations of Oklahoma, emphasizes the importance of acknowledgment and respect. Through the permanence of metal signage in his Native Host Signs, Heap of Birds solidifies and honors the presence of the many tribes in New York, while emphasizing their painful erasure in history.\r\nHeap of Birds\u2019 pastel drawings further this political response. The gesture itself is intense and direct, as is the text itself. The words, typically grouped into threes, command attention with their vivid colors and deliberate pairings. In Boost West, a 15-drawing installation, the words \u201cGOOD BYE EFFECT\u201d are flush with \u201cYELLOW BLUE GREEN\u201d, accentuating the hypocrisy of obliterating nations whose ideologies surrounds the preservation of the earth, which no human can survive without. In these drawing installations, the words do not compete with one another, but rather allow for a reverberation of meaning.\r\nHeap of Birds challenges the concept of linear time. In his work, he navigates through events of the past, emphasizing their pertinence in the present and foretelling their future effects. Though his paintings are not outwardly political, they honor the earth and thus remind viewers of the destruction humans cause the planet. These works, depicted in his Blue Neuf series at the gallery, are far more lyrical in nature, having evolved while Heap of Birds lived above a Canyon in Oklahoma. Transcending time, the shapes themselves resemble rock formations, as well as fish and Juniper trees that he presently surrounds himself with but have also been part of the earth for millennia. The paintings are made four at a time, a practice which relates to Cheyenne cosmology and the directions north, east, south and west, further grounding the works into the earth itself. In these pieces, Heap of Birds discusses his personal connection to land while allowing viewers to question their own relationship with the earth.\r\nThe monoprint and ghost print installation, Standing Rock, debuting at the gallery, reiterates the presence of Indigenous people in this hemisphere, while further stressing the dangers of environmental destruction. A response to the 2016 Dakota Access Pipeline protests, this piece celebrates the unity of Native tribes who have come together in protest to honor the earth and water, while fighting back against the powers who threaten to destroy natural resources. Statements such as \u201cWATER IS OUR FIRST MEDICINE\u201d and \u201cARMED TROOPS SECURITY POLICE ATTACK DOGS\u201d filter the complexity of protest into a few deliberate words, highlighting water as a vital life source while emphasizing police violence towards Indigenous people. Through his remarks on civil rights, violence, and the relationship between indigeneity and the earth, Hock E Aye Vi Edgar Heap of Birds expands the conversation into a larger question of humanity, challenging the notion of sovereignty itself.", "artforumID": 181236, "showStart": "2020-01-11T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17396/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Hock E Aye Vi Edgar Heap of Birds, Home Stands Alone, 1990, pastel drawing on paper, 22 x 30 inches", "gallery": "Fort Gansevoort", "galleryDescription": "Established in 2015 and located in the heart of the Meatpacking District, Fort Gansevoort is a contemporary art gallery.", "address": "5 Ninth Avenue", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10014", "lng": -74.0066646, "lat": 40.739578691143, "hours": "Tue - Sat 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "fortgansevoort.com", "galleryEmail": "gallery@fortgansevoort.com", "phone": "+19176393113", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.835Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.835Z"}, {"id": 164, "title": "Kathleen Craig & Sarah Lubin", "description": null, "artforumID": 181252, "showStart": "2020-01-09T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17412/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Sarah Lubin, &#8220;Taking Notes,&#8221; 2019, oil on canvas, 36 x 48 inches", "gallery": "Nancy Margolis Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Nancy Margolis Gallery specializes in contemporary art.

The exhibition features a new body of work created over the past two years, defined by Geva\u2019s focus on deconstruction and abstraction to convey the emotional and cultural tenor of his surroundings.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMotifs of terrazzo tiles, stone walls, and latticework, which have been prevalent in Geva\u2019s paintings since the nineteen-nineties, are pushed to the forefront in these new works. These Mediterranean urban patterns, once abstracted, become a reflection of a collective subconscious, revealing a conflicted, restless landscape where borders are in a constant negotiation.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe various patterns are applied in layers that flow into one another, in entropic fashion. With expressive and spontaneous gestures, Geva collapses the distance between the precarious cultural amalgam of the present and the region\u2019s splintered history.

The world\u2019s leading dealer in the art of the European Middle Ages, Sam Fogg has for the past thirty years mounted ground-breaking exhibitions that challenge and redefine perceptions of Medieval and Renaissance art. Following Of Earth and Heaven, the acclaimed 2018 collaborative exhibition between the two galleries, Gothic Spirit will present for the first time in a contemporary context roughly thirty masterpieces that are among the finest Medieval art to be found in private hands. The exhibition will be on view through March 7, 2020 and accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue.\r\n\r\nHighlights include a massive pair of stone lions carved by Romanesque sculptors for a grand portal in Northern Italy. Believed to have been from a group of four, the other pair now resides in the Cloisters Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, making this occasion the first time in nearly two hundred years that the set is reunited in the same city. A golden orb made in the 1170s to crown a monumental reliquary shrine in the chapel of Saint Ursula in Cologne will be among a group of exquisite treasury objects on view. It represents a completely new discovery, having been removed by the city\u2019s Napoleonic occupiers in around 1800 and now recognized as a missing fragment from one of the earliest and most impressive shrines of its type. A monumental stained-glass window depicting a lavishly dressed donatrix kneeling before two female saints represents a significant and rare example of female patronage from the Middle Ages. It was made for one of the richest churches of Cologne in the late 1520s and has endured five hundred years of iconoclasm, bomb damage, and neglect in almost pristine condition.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition also features two limewood works: a nearly life-sized sculpture of a grieving Virgin, carved in a French workshop around 1150 and later acquired by William Waldorf Astor for Hever Castle, and a relief by the German Renaissance sculptor Hans Leinberger, carved as part of a famous performative and didactic sculpture called the Landshut Marianum in circa 1516-18.  Another remarkable piece is a painting of the Nativity created circa 1430 by the single most important proponent of Viennese painting.\r\n\r\nGothic Spirit will be presented in conjunction with a one-day conference, Restoring the Past: Destruction, Restoration and Preservation of Medieval Art and Architecture, on Saturday, January 25, 10:30am \u2013 6pm at the SVA Theatre, 333 West 23rd Street, New York. Inspired by the issues surrounding the efforts to restore the cathedral of Notre Dame, Paris and its treasures, this conference will focus on the past, present, and future of restoration in an attempt to examine the enduring life of Medieval art from its creation in the Middle Ages to today.\r\n\r\nThe conference is free and open to the public, but advance booking is essential to secure a place.

By manipulating texturally incongruous materials such as silicone and steel, Levy produces tactile structures that arouse an acute bodily awareness. Her references are broad: medical equipment, hardware, prosthetics, vegetables, and furniture are anthropomorphized through welded curves and cast appendages that relate to the human form. The scale of recognizable, everyday objects is often distorted to the point of absurdity, resulting in uncanny configurations\r\nthat have lost their original function. Expanding upon the visual language of artists such as Eva Hesse, Louise Bourgeois and Meret Oppenheim, Levy\u2019s sculptures are defined by their materiality and bodily consciousness.\r\n\r\nFor this exhibition, Levy presents a series of new works formally inspired by domestic d\u00e9cor and objects of recreation. Through these referents, her sculptures engage the aspirations and insecurities embedded within our designed environments. All of the works contain competing dualities - erotic and sterile, seductive and repulsive, humorous and disconcerting - to subvert the concept of \u201ctastemaking\u201d perpetuated by interior and industrial design.\r\n\r\nIn the main entryway gallery, three large-scale works hang from the ceiling on thick, metal chains. The elaborate sculptures recall distorted chandeliers \u2013 once symbols of wealth and nobility, that have since devolved into cheaply-produced and often gaudy commodities. In Levy\u2019s adaptation, the metal sculptures are shaped by exaggerated, sensual curves and adorned with flesh-like silicone, reflecting a perverse eroticism often hidden in modern design. Oversized and presented low to the ground, the sculptures confront the viewer with their own physicality and elicit a corporeal discomfort through both tactile and formal means. One work is furnished with a series of alarmingly sharp hooks, indulgently pierced with over a dozen silicone cast gourds. Another holds a large, silicone pool inflatable with distinguished air valves that take on suggestive connotations at this exaggerated scale. While amusing, the works\u2019 humor is bellied by a latent anxiety that permeates throughout the exhibition.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the extravagance of the chandeliers, a series of modestly-scaled fixtures, recalling light sconces, line the walls of the gallery. Each metal armature is welded into a curved point and holds a cast asparagus in lieu of a candle or lamp. The plump, tactile silicone is pigmented in anemic shades of beige, accentuating a homogeneous, flesh-like quality. Enlarged several times over, the asparagus rests languidly over the nickel plated steel - limp and phallic. On the floor lays a large, free-standing sculpture, embellished with menacing metal springs and taught, stretched silicone. The structure appears familiar, but the scale remains awkwardly undetermined \u2013 smaller than an outdoor trampoline, but larger than indoor rehabilitation equipment.\r\n\r\nLevy transitions into a two-dimensional plane within the remaining gallery space, engaging recurrent themes through different means. In this room, a photograph portrays a manicured set of hands baiting a fishhook with a live worm. Recreational fishing is a pastime with both blue-collar and aristocratic affiliation. In contrast with this subject matter, the sleek, commercial aesthetic of the photograph suggests the very notion of gratuitous leisure might be illusory. The haptic focus of the image intensifies the tactility which binds all of the works in the exhibition and acknowledges the persistent desire to touch in an increasingly virtual world.\r\n\r\nAll of the works in the show conflate flesh and steel, encapsulating the bodily integration of the once external machine. With a keen material sensibility, Levy\u2019s sculptures reflect the internalization of our built and bought environments. Each component exists with the potential to be consumed, in a perverse metabolic cycle that questions the very nature of consumption - both biologic and cultural.\r\n\r\nLevy (b, 1991, New York) received her MFA from St\u00e4delschule, Frankfurtin 2015. She has held recent solo exhibitions at Fondazione Coppola, Vicenza, Italy (2020); C L E A R I N G, New York (2018), Mother\u2019s Tankstation, Dublin (2018); Fourteen30 Contemporary, Portland (2017); White Flag Projects, St. Louis (2016) and Galerie Parisa Kind, Frankfurt (2015). Additionally, her work has been exhibited at museums internationally, including: G2 Kunsthalle, Leipzig, Germany; Yuz Museum, Shanghai; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Denmark; Museum of Modern Art, Humleb\u00e6k; MoMA PS1, New York; the Frankfurter Kunstverein, Frankfurt; SCAD Museum of Art, Savannah; Palais de Tokyo, Paris; Lever House, New York and Museum F\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt.

The exhibition at 24 W 40, restages one of the artist\u2019s rarely presented audio installations alongside preparatory drawings and diagrams. By making sound a key element in \"Voice,\" Morris challenges the expectation that a work of art must be material, visual, and actively created by the artist. Although the piece incorporates material elements\u2014including speakers and felt-covered boxes that serve as seats for visitors\u2014these components function primarily as supports for the audio recording. The three-and-a-half-hour-long audio piece is divided into four parts, each of which consists of two tracks that have been spliced together. In each section, Morris uses the intangible medium of sound to tangibly alter visitors\u2019 spatial awareness\u2014whether by playing tracks through different speakers, using distortion effects, or overlaying tracks played at different volumes.\r\n\r\nThe spoken content of \"Voice\" reinforces the work\u2019s rejection of conventional aesthetic principles by deconstructing examples of authority that perform similar functions on a cultural level: those that determine the possible forms of subjective experience within a society. For example, in the third section of the recording, a male voice speaks in a subdued tone about a painful scar on his body. Meanwhile, a second louder track plays in which a different male voice recites entries from \"The Guinness Book of World Records\". In this mash-up, the record of legitimized accomplishments nearly drowns out the narrative of individual pain. \"Voice\" also challenges language as a system which regulates the ways we verbally articulate our inner thoughts and emotions. The work\u2019s title suggests Morris\u2019 privileging of the voice as the unformed \u201cmaterial\u201d that language marshals into a specific form. \r\n    The anti-authoritarian spirit that animates \"Voice\" is likewise present in Morris\u2019 \"Blind Time\" and \"Labyrinth\" drawings, a selection of which will be on view at the gallery\u2019s uptown location at 18 E 77. In 1974, all three bodies of work were debuted in the exhibition \"Robert Morris: Labyrinths\u2014Voice\u2014Blind Time\", held simultaneously at Castelli and Sonnabend Gallery. The structure of the labyrinth evokes the confines of the social system that the individual must navigate. Meanwhile, in his \"Blind Time\" drawings, made with eyes closed, Morris intentionally abandons vision as the artist\u2019s primary means of controlling his medium and exerting his creative intention. In this respect, \"Voice\" offers insight into Morris\u2019 approach to art-making as an essentially political act, premised on an awareness of the continuity between the oppressive powers operative in art and society.", "artforumID": 181452, "showStart": "2020-01-11T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-28T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17612/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Robert Morris, &#8220;Untitled&#8221;, 1997, ink on paper, 46 x 60 inches", "gallery": "Castelli Gallery | Uptown", "galleryDescription": "Founded by Leo Castelli in 1957", "address": "18 E 77 St\n3", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10075", "lng": -73.98325915, "lat": 40.752573013685, "hours": "Tue - Sat 10am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "castelligallery.com", "galleryEmail": "info@castelligallery.com", "phone": "+12122494470", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.840Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.840Z"}, {"id": 202, "title": "Painting the Japanese Blues: Introducing Issei Nishimura", "description": "Painting the Japanese Blues: Introducing Issei Nishimura\r\n(January 9 - February 15, 2020)\r\n\r\n\r\nIssei Nishimura has a number of obsessions but these three are the most important: the blues, his cats, and making drawings and paintings.  Obsession might be too mild a word for the passion and time this prolific artist puts into artmaking.  There is a beautiful chaos in his work that is held together by the consistencies in his wild style including off kilter, sometimes cartoon like, sometimes purely beautiful pictorial associations, and the wild colors that blend in such a way as to create new juxtapositions of tonalities much the way a blues note flattens and bends and extends the possibilities of meaning and emotion in the original note.  \r\n\r\nEdward Madrid G\u00f3mez said in Hyperallergic in (12/09) 2017: \u201cFor Nishimura, who was a guitar player before turning to drawing and painting, makes art inspired by and steeped in the blues.  If ever that music- so redolent of yearning, loss, soulfulness, and psychic pain- were to find visual expression, here in Nishimura\u2019s art, perhaps most unexpectedly, it has.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say \u201cNishimura was born in 1978 in Nagoya, Japan.  In Nagoya, I also met the artist\u2019s father, Usao, who recalled that, as a child, Issei enjoyed making drawings.  Years later, after moving to Tokyo to study music, he began having a hard time fitting into society and started to withdraw.  Soon his artmaking assumed a central urgent place in his life, and, before long, he committed his energy full time to producing drawings and paintings.  He moved back home to Nagoya, where he resides today, reclusively, in a close-knit family setting.  Issei loves and still plays his music, and he enjoys the companionship of his cats, but he rarely ventures out.  To date, he has not seen any of the group or solo exhibitions in which his works have been publicly displayed.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe are proud to present the first American solo exhibition of Issei Nishimura that will include a rich combination of his paintings, drawings and notebooks.  We will also feature his work at the 2020 Outsider Art Fair.\r\n\r\nFor additional information please contact\u00a0info@cavinmorris.com\u00a0or call us at\u00a0212-226-3768.", "artforumID": 181484, "showStart": "2020-01-09T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17644/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Cavin Morris Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Cavin Morris Gallery specializes in outsider art, indigenous, self-taught, Art Brut, ceramics & textiles.

Kyle Eyre Clyd, the longtime moniker of Alabama-based, interdisciplinary artist Kyle Kessler, also presents new work. In late 2019, Bassett released Kyle Eyre Clyd\u2019s Eggshell on her Yew Recordings imprint.\r\n\r\nKyle Eyre Clyd presents new work exploring the figure of the medieval artisan as a figure who is not mad but is becoming-mad and in this half-state of identity, addresses the cosmos. The performance features archaic texts of visionaries accompanied by a de-healing drone whose timbres and transitions induce feelings of nausea and simulate auditory hallucinations. Abstracted close-ups, drag, and vocal pitch shifting in video presentation accompany live manipulation of sound.\r\n\r\nThroughout her artistic practice, Marcia Bassett has sought to induce trance-like-states of mind through her multifaceted audiovisual work. For Out-SIDe PATtern RE-configuration, Bassett explores the interaction of sound and light and their resulting forms, using analog and digital tools and real-time composition to manipulate and abstract sound into seemingly chaotic and fragmented parts. Interrelations between sound and visual projections unfold in timed sequences organized into areas of duration to further emphasize random relationships, abstractions, and conflict. Her visual presentation expands upon an experimental super 8mm film that she shot, edited and composed a soundtrack for in July 2019 titled \u201cMorning Reflections,\u201d plus slide projections from artist Barry Weisblat.\r\n\r\nArtist/musician Marcia Bassett works in areas of sound, improvisation, live composition and visual creations. Bassett's work is equal parts trance and critique. Her sound pieces thread the needle between the conceptual and the sensual, between ritual invocation and cold semiotic gaze. Using handmade electronic instruments, prepared guitar, synthesizer, field recordings and tape explorations, Bassett deftly wields philosophical systems to produce heady, experiential clouds; pushing through drones into provocative soundscapes \u2013 the intangible narratives of dreams. Bassett frequently performs and tours under her solo moniker Za\u00efmph. As an improviser and sound artist she also frequently joins others in collaborative installations and multimedia projects. Recent collaborative presentations include work with Ursula Scherrer, OptoSonic Tea a site-specific group improvisation and OptoSonic Echoes an 8-channel continuous sound installation and at The Parrish Museum, Water Mill, NY; \"The Eternal Now\" Buchla Music Easel improvisation with Ted Gordon and colorslide stroboscopic light experiments by Jeffrey Perkins at The Diffusion Festival, Baltimore. D.C.; \u201cSurvival Of Laments\u201d a live improvisation with Margarida Garcia and Manuel Mota at Festival Oude Muziek 2018, Utrecht, and guitar and violin improvisations with Samara Lubelski. Marcia Bassett's and Samara Lubelski\u2019s LP \u2019Morning Flare Symmetries\u2019 will be available in 2020 on Feeding Tube Records. Past collaborations and solo projects include work with Andrew Lafkas\u2019 large ensemble Alternate Models; \"Transitory Freezing of Perpetual Motion\" improvised sound performance with Jenny Graf and dancers at Here-10 Evenings Festival, Sweden; \u201cField Recording with Za\u00efmph,\u201d BOMB magazine, and \"Out of Line: Narcissister\" live improvised sound interaction with the performance, High Line, NYC. Additionally, she created an original soundtrack for the 2013, Single Channel Video, \"Ten Ways of Doing Time\", written and directed by James Fotopoulos and Laura Parnes.\r\n\r\nKyle Eyre Clyd is the longtime moniker of artist Kyle Kessler, an interdisciplinary artist living and working in Birmingham, AL. She has exhibited and performed at the Contemporary Art Center New Orleans, Sculpture Center (NY), Artist Space (NY), ISSUE Project Room (NY), The Stone (NY), PPOW Gallery (NY) and at numerous experimental music festivals. Her music has been played live on WFMU and on small radio stations worldwide. She holds an MFA in Sound from Bard College and a BFA from the Cooper Union. Her sound work is often the result of collaborations with other musicians and thinkers. She has worked with Keith Connolly, Samara Lubelski, Lea Bertucci, Patrick Cole, Dylan Hay, Anthony Saunders, Peter Bowling, and many more. Her new work is a textual and memorial digression from her time spent performing hundreds of shows in the noise underground and its tangential queer communities. It approaches sound from a contemplative, impressionistic perspective and the plastic arts from a conceptual one. Themes may shift on a project-by-project basis but consistently one feels the influence of semiotic interpretations of art punctuated by a haunted delivery and mystic poeticism.", "artforumID": 181597, "showStart": "2020-02-14T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-14T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17757/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Marcia Bassett, Pattern Reconfiguration Slide Projection", "gallery": "ISSUE Project Room", "galleryDescription": "ISSUE Project Room is a pioneering presenter of experimental performance.", "address": "22 Boerum Place", "city": "Brooklyn", "zip": "NY 11201", "lng": -73.9897215, "lat": 40.690846713655, "hours": "Mon - Fri 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "issueprojectroom.org", "galleryEmail": "info@issueprojectroom.org", "phone": "+17183300313", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.855Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.855Z"}, {"id": 212, "title": "Seed", "description": null, "artforumID": 181609, "showStart": "2020-02-06T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-20T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17769/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Judi Harvest, detail from Past, Present + Future (Bee + Pollen), 2017", "gallery": "David Krut Projects | New York", "galleryDescription": "David Krut Projects, New York (DKNY) was established in September 2001 in the West Chelsea building.", "address": "526 West 26th Street\nSUITE 816, 8TH FLOOR", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10001", "lng": -74.00430545, "lat": 40.749977913683, "hours": "Wed - Fri 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "davidkrut.com", "galleryEmail": "info@davidkrut.com", "phone": "+12122553094", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.855Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.855Z"}, {"id": 217, "title": "Weird Nature", "description": "GREENPOINT TERMINAL GALLERY\r\n67 West St. #320\r\nBrooklyn, NY 11222\r\nInfo@greenpointterminalgallery.com\r\nGreenpointterminalgallery.com\r\n\r\nWeird Nature\r\nRoxanne Jackson\r\nGracelee Lawrence\r\nHeidi Norton\r\nBrent Owens\r\n\r\nJanuary 17 \u2013 February 21, 2020\r\nOpening Reception January 17, 7-10pm\r\n\r\nRoxanne Jackson is a ceramic artist and mixed-media sculptor living in Brooklyn, NY.

The paintings of Roger Tibbetts at first insist a poetic, hard edge finality, but closer inspection reveals their weathered, shifting surfaces; geometric painting that survived battle.\r\n\r\nThe worked acrylic surfaces present silky, meditative fields, punctuated by moments where Tibbetts snaps us back to the reality of the making; with constellations of drawn lines, dots, and physical holes. Large shapes of color are balanced with these thin, mathematical components, exposed amongst the layers. The linear elements reinforce the flatness of the surface, while also creating illusions of prisms and oblongs in space. \r\n \r\nTibbetts works, which range from ten inches to almost ten feet, are created with expanses of muted colors built up by limited palettes. Black and white often dominate the entire surface, with touches of reds, pinks, blues, and purples. The areas of color may seem singular, but the compounding of decisions builds milky films of fluctuating color and opacity. \r\n\r\nRecto/ Verso includes Tibbetts\u2019 drawings and works on paper that reveal more directly the architectural line work and unlikely prisms layered in the paintings. They provide a key to the mysterious schematics revealed between and on top of the stratum of built up color, while still not giving away the structures they map. Pencil, ink, and acrylic are worked into plastic and paper with a combination of precision and chance. \r\n\r\nRoger Tibbetts received an MFA from Yale University School of Art (1975), as well as completing studies at the Chelsea School of Art, London, England (1972) and Wolverhampton College of Art, England (1971). Exhibitions of his work include solo and group shows at Bannister Gallery Rhode Island College, The Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Bernard Toale Gallery, Boston, Mercer Street Gallery NYC, Ruggiero Gallery NYC, and the Bakalar and Paine Galleries at MassArt.

Centered on Tokata Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe who has been involved with the movement to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline since its inception, the video continues Bowers\u2019s commitment to documenting important activists of her time. Bowers asked the young activist to show her some of her most sacred places in South Dakota. With a small group of friends - all artists and activists, they traveled together for 4 days in September recording video interviews and landscape drone shots of the youth activist discussing the landscapes, their histories, as well as the personal and political issues that arose from being in these sacred sites. In the Lakota language, \u201cTokata\u201d means \u201cFuture\u201d.\r\nIn response to her journey with Iron Eyes and the climate emergency we are currently experiencing, Bowers has created a new series of neon works based on the designs of tree branches that incorporate quotes from eco-feminists. These monumental and sculptural pieces are made entirely of reused and recycled materials, inspired by Judi Bari and the Earth First! call to action, \u201cResist Reuse Restore\u201d.\r\nAndrea Bowers lives and works in Los Angeles, CA.

Debuting the entirety of his seminal Doors, NYC (1975-76) project at 504 West 24th Street, this marks the first ever comprehensive presentation of this monumental photographic project, while significant sections have previously been exhibited at PS1 and the New York Public Library. After beginning his career as a painter at the prominent Hochschule f\u00fcr Bildende K\u00fcnste in Hamburg, Germany, Colmer abandoned the medium and his preferred method of deployment, the spraygun, just ten years after graduation, and by 1975 he worked exclusively in photography and film. Doors, NYC is both his most expansive and his most recognized series. \r\n\r\nFrom November of 1975 to September of 1976, Colmer photographed the doors of every building, shop and restaurant he encountered, rendering his adopted hometown of New York City in a sequential but not strictly exhaustive manner \u2013 given that the occasional chain-link fence makes an appearance among the more traditional entry ways. He covered 120 intersections and streets across more than 3,000 images, all of which will be on view at Lisson, from areas ranging from Fort Washington to Wall Street and everywhere in between. While the photographs could initially be perceived as documentary in nature, recording the state of each block at a given moment without a predetermined path or objective, Colmer saw each image as part of a greater conceptual exercise. After each day\u2019s outing, he inscribed the trajectory of every journey and city block in an index \u2013 noting whether he had captured the north or south side of the street, for example, and thus the odd or even address numbers.\r\n\r\nMuch like his Conceptual contemporaries On Kawara or Hanne Darboven (whom he met in art school at Hamburg where he also first experimented with photographing a series of doors, including a photo of the door of the barn at Darboven\u2019s home), Colmer was interested in the passage of time, and how the structure which defines it is shaped by personal experience. He studied fellow English immigrant Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s investigation of time as it related to motion and motion-picture projection and was influenced by documentary photography pioneer Eugene Atget\u2019s images of Parisian shop windows, in addition to Berenice Abbott\u2019s portraits of New York City in the 1930s. The series title is derived from a line from the passage Doors of Perception from English poet William Blake\u2019s book The Marriage of Heaven and Hell \u2013 \u201cIf the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro\u2019 narrow chinks of his cavern.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Doors, NYC series draws comparisons to the work of Hilla and Bernd Becher as well \u2013 a shared cataloguing of urban forms, frontality of form and a similar structured, serial presentation. But while the Bechers abided by a self-imposed formal system \u2013 photographing at certain times of the day and under specific lighting conditions to create stark, unemotional and sometimes melancholic portrayals of their subjects \u2013 Colmer created no guidelines for his pictures and operated his camera with a looser hand, arguably having as much in common with the conceptual as with the street photography of Lisette Model, with whom he studied at the New School in New York. As the viewer looks closely at his photographs, there are glimpses of not only the artist\u2019s reflection but also passers-by, sometimes not fully in the frame. Colmer deliberately chose to capture New York City as he viewed it and as Blake described \u2013 raw, unedited and imperfect, liberated from reason or order, and entirely full of possibility.", "artforumID": 181610, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17770/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Lisson Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Lisson Gallery specializes in contemporary art.

Comprised of two labs, the exhibition binds to an interrogation of speech (enunciation, silence, erasure) and flesh (consumption, contamination, containment) to consider how systems of language and digestion are irrevocably entangled.\r\n\r\nIn lab one, Jesse Chun presents sculpture and sound installation that vestigates the bureaucratic and institutional mechanisms of language and legibility. Working with a range of found materials that render one readable as a subject\u2014such as audio pronunciation tutorials for the world\u2019s \u201ccommon language\u201d, English; watermarks for authenticating bureaucratic documents and certificates; and materiality of handwriting such as graphite, Chun actively mistranslates and re-authors the pre-existing devices of power, control, and meaning. Through visual, sonic, and semiotic abstractions, she considers new poetics of legibility, interiority, and the untranslatable.\r\n\r\nIn lab two, Tiffany Jaeyeon Shin transforms onggi &#50745;&#44592; vases, traditional Korean earthenware dating back to 5000 BC, into an impenetrable glassy surface. Onggi draws breath from its microporous surface, critical for the function to ferment foods and allow optimal air flow. Once organic and permeable, onggi vases become vitrified into the sterile flesh and smell of Western modernity, nestled in the making of a modern surface after the Korean War. Diffused mugwort envelops the space, exploring the conceptual terrains of contamination and containment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle and excerpt from Theresa Hak Kyung Cha\u2019s Dict\u00e9e, 1982", "artforumID": 181792, "showStart": "2020-01-16T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17952/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Courtesy the artists.", "gallery": "DOOSAN Gallery | New York", "galleryDescription": "DOOSAN Gallery specializes in Korean contemporary art.

In her newest work, she seeks to unite the fortuitous and the precise: paintings on and of wood resembling demolished wall fragments and modernist house floorplans. This union activates perceptions of physical fragility and ideological failure. The use of architectural tools addresses the devastated space with the semantics of its own construction, \u00a0mapping a sort of cartography of desolation and oblivion.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe works in the exhibition draw upon a paradoxical bond between architecture\u00a0\u2014a language of construction par excellence\u2014 and the language of destruction and dislocation.

Cast whole in aluminum and painted with enamels and oils, Cowan\u2019s works unhinge their source material from its usual function and straddle the categories of painting, sculpture, and drawing. The exhibition\u2019s title borrows from a line in a poem written by SJ Cowan and draws upon the referential affinities of the artist\u2019s chosen materials, which spill across landscapes both earthly and imaginary.", "artforumID": 181575, "showStart": "2020-01-15T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-07T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17735/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Katy Cowan, &#8220;(this material to itself: sweeping) Position,&#8221; 2019", "gallery": "Kate Werble Gallery", "galleryDescription": "The gallery is located in west SoHo between Hudson St. and Greenwich St. Please contact the gallery for further information.", "address": "83 Vandam Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10013", "lng": -74.0078349, "lat": 40.726771513672, "hours": "Tue - Sat 11am to 6pm", "galleryURL": "katewerblegallery.com", "galleryEmail": "info@katewerblegallery.com", "phone": "+12123529700", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.841Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.841Z"}, {"id": 209, "title": "ABSTRACTION: HOT AND COOL", "description": null, "artforumID": 181604, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17764/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Susie Rosmarin  (#243) Red/Blue/Green, 2001  acrylic on canvas  60 x 60 inches", "gallery": "DANESE/COREY", "galleryDescription": "Danese Corey Gallery specializes in contemporary art.

He returned from Europe to enroll at the University of Wisconsin, exploring what it meant to \u201cbe a starving artist\u201d and sending hand written letters-to-the-editor of Artforum. When esteemed critic Robert Pincus-Witten published a two-page spread with Witz\u2019s submissions in the September 1973 issue, the Midwesterner moved to Manhattan. He founded the East Village magazine Appearances wherein artists such as Bill Jensen and Betty Tompkins published their pictures alongside offbeat poetry and fiction by prisoners. For more than 30 years, Witz has resided in a Chelsea loft cluttered with pieces of the past, but his childhood in \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dairyland\u201d has continued to influence his art, especially his choice of materials!\r\nSince the 1970\u2019s Bob Witz has been producing Milk Carton Sculptures that vary in height from 9 to 50 inches covered with cardboard, layers of oil paint, and found materials, such as bottle caps, rubber bands, coins, tin cans, hair ties, bobby-pins and wire. All start out as found milk cartons -- some become bronzes cast from molds of milk carton constructions. All get painted and embellished.\r\nIn the 1970s and 80s Bob Witz was known as a publisher and painter who exhibited at spaces like Fashion Moda and Rivington Street, but no gallery ever represented him. In 2012 Phong Bui curated a solo show at The New York Studio School; in 2018 Melissa Wolf and Paul Lamarre installed some of his sculptures at Plato\u2019s Cave; and in 2019 Andrew Edlin included his work in a summer group show. During a studio visit this past December, the artist paused his on going modifications of works that have been in progress for decades to allow us to curate a selection for this exhibition at OSMOS entitled \u201cBob Witz: Milk Made\u201d.\r\nThe work will remain on view until February 26, 2020.\r\n\r\nContact Cay Sophie Rabinowitz osmos.address@gmail.com +1 646 559 5347", "artforumID": 181813, "showStart": "2020-01-17T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-28T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id17973/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Everybody and Nobody, 1980 \u2013 2019, mixed media, milk carton, rubber bands, hair pins and paint, circa 13 x 5 x 5 inches, photo Paul Lamarre", "gallery": "OSMOS Address", "galleryDescription": "OSMOS is a project space founded by Cay Sophie Rabinowitz for art gatherings, publications, and exhibitions in the East Village.", "address": "50 E 1st Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10003", "lng": -73.989519, "lat": 40.723979013671, "hours": "Mon - Thu 11am to 5pm", "galleryURL": "n/a", "galleryEmail": "osmos.address@gmail.com", "phone": "+16465595347", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.858Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.858Z"}, {"id": 234, "title": null, "description": null, "artforumID": 181893, "showStart": "2020-01-14T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18053/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Photo: Guillaume Ziccarelli \u00a9 Courtesy of the artist &amp; Perrotin", "gallery": "Perrotin | New York", "galleryDescription": "Perrotin specializes in contemporary art.

Although Wheeler began his career as a painter, his wall-mounted artworks soon began incorporating light as a medium and quickly gave way to an art-historical breakthrough: the construction of an absolute light environment, created in his Venice Beach studio in 1967. On view at the gallery will be an installation by the artist that further expands on his earliest investigations of the possibilities of luminous space.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, Wheeler was invited to realize an environmental installation at the Stedelijk Museum, in Amsterdam, using neon light embedded inside a viewing aperture that encompassed the entire surface area of the gallery wall within an enclosed, entirely white room. He stretched translucent nylon scrim overhead, creating a virtual ceiling that captured and reflected light and appeared to float above the room. The resultant environment produced the effect of light as a tactile and dense mass that enveloped the viewer while articulating a luminous volume, or plane, across the expanse of a wall. The work was at once inviting, immersive, and expansive. As artist Daniel Buren has noted upon recalling his impressions of Wheeler\u2019s installation at the Stedelijk, \u201cOne was no longer seeing a work: one was experiencing a spatial event. One was entering into light.\u201d1\r\n\r\nSubsequent iterations of this type of installation by the artist have explored distinct atmospheric and perceptual effects and have been presented at institutions that include the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven (1969); Ace Gallery, Los Angeles (1970); and, more recently, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2004); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC (2008\u20132009); Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (2011\u20132012); and 49 Nord 6 Est \u2013 FRAC Lorraine, Metz, France (2012), where the work on view in this exhibition at David Zwirner was first presented.\r\n\r\n49 Nord 6 Est 68 Ven 12 FL (2011\u20132012) culminates the evolution of this body of work and exemplifies Wheeler\u2019s evolving and refined employment of light, technology, and architecture to transform the gallery and to engage the viewers\u2019 phenomenological perception of pure light and space.\r\n\r\nThis is Wheeler\u2019s fourth solo exhibition at David Zwirner and coincides with the release of the first major monograph devoted to his work. The most comprehensive overview of the artist\u2019s career to date, this publication includes new scholarship by art historian Germano Celant and features extensive illustrations of Wheeler\u2019s most significant works from the early 1960s to the present, as well as never before published images, drawings, and other archival material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDoug Wheeler (b. 1939) was raised in the high desert of Arizona and began his career as a painter while studying at the Chouinard Art Institute (now the California Institute of the Arts) in Los Angeles in the early 1960s.\r\n\r\nWheeler\u2019s first solo exhibitions were held at the Pasadena Art Museum, Pasadena, California (1968); Ace Gallery, Los Angeles (1970); Galerie Schmela, D\u00fcsseldorf (1970); Mizuno Gallery, Los Angeles (1974, 1979); and Galleria Salvatore Ala, Milan (1975). His early environmental work was included in a number of important exhibitions in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, such as Robert Irwin \u2013 Doug Wheeler, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, (1969); Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, Doug Wheeler, Tate Gallery, London (1970); Rooms P.S. 1, The Institute for Art and Urban Resources at P.S.1, Long Island City, New York (1976); Ambiente Arte, 37th Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy (1976); and The First Show: Painting and Sculpture from Eight Collections, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (the Temporary Contemporary) (1983\u20131984), among others. In 1975, Wheeler\u2019s environmental projects from this period, some existing only as detailed architectural plan drawings, were acquired by Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, the noted Italian collector of American postwar art.\r\n\r\nWheeler\u2019s work has been presented in notable international exhibitions, including Sunshine & Noir: Art in L.A. 1960\u20131997, which traveled from the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark, to Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany, Castello di Rivoli, Turin, and UCLA/The Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, Los Angeles (1997\u20131999);  Changing Perceptions: The Panza Collection at the Guggenheim Museum, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2000\u20132001); Time & Place: Los Angeles 1957\u20131968, Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2008\u20132009), which traveled to Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich as the exhibitionHot Spots: Rio de Janeiro/Milano/Los Angeles 1956\u20131969(2009); and Primary Atmospheres: Works from California 1960\u20131970, David Zwirner, New York (2010).\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the artist exhibited a new \u201ccontinuum atmospheric environment\u201d at David Zwirner, New York. His work was also featured in Phenomenal: California Light, Space, Surface at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, as part of the Getty Research Institute\u2019s Pacific Standard Time initiative (2011\u20132012). 49 Nord 6 Est \u2013 FRAC Lorraine, Metz, France, presented a solo exhibition of Wheeler\u2019s work in 2012, and his work was included in Light Show, at the Hayward Gallery, Southbank Centre, London, in 2013. In 2014, a new \u201crotational horizon\u201d installation by the artist, a culmination of circular works begun in the 1970s, occupied the ground floor of David Zwirner\u2019s West 20th Street location in New York, and, later that year, Wheeler presented a new light environment at Palazzo Grassi in Venice in conjunction with the group exhibition The Illusion of Light. In 2016, Doug Wheeler: Encasements was on view at David Zwirner, New York, and his 1976 PS1 installation was re-created for the anniversary exhibition Forty at MoMA/PS1, New York. The following year, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York presented Doug Wheeler: PSAD Synthetic Desert III, in which the artist realized a work conceived and drawn in 1971, transforming one of the museum galleries into a hermetic, \u201csemi-anechoic chamber\u201d that reduced ambient sound to imperceptible levels and produced the sensory impression of infinite space, an experience akin to those the artist describes in the vast desert spaces of Northern Arizona and New Mexico. Wheeler\u2019s work was recently on view at the Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin as part of the exhibition Welt ohne Au\u00dfen/World without Exterior. Immersive Spaces since the 1960s (2018). \r\n\r\nWork by the artist is held in prominent museum collections worldwide, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York; Glenstone Museum, Potomac, Maryland; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego; the Panza Collection, Mendrisio, Switzerland; Pinault Collection, Paris; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; Solomon R.

The title, \"Toxic Halo,\" is a phrase from a song written by the artist called \u201cRuin.\u201d \"Sunlight hits the flesh, the air repeats your name, like a toxic halo around me.\" In her paintings, radiant halos surround figures and trees, amplifying the color relationships between shapes and their environment. Coates\u2019s color choices-- phosphorescent green and jaundice yellow combined with synthetic pink and corporate lavender-- are both glowing and sickly toxic. She manipulates the inherent trans-parent properties of acrylic paint to achieve a surprising and unique luminescence.\r\n\r\nCoates\u2019s process is linked both to the ancient divination practices of generating stories about the future through tea leaves, ripples in water, even entrails, as well as surrealist automatism-- where artists would find imagery through accident. She begins her paintings with spills, stamping, or other intuitive gestures to generate a charged surface from which forms emerge and inform her subject matter. The painting \"Haruspicy\" lifts a dead cow from an ancient Roman relief sculpture of diviners examining its innards; the etymology of the word \u201charuspicy\u201d literally means to look at entrails. This painting, the only large one in the show, depicts the cow\u2019s insides departing its body to animate and merge with the forest around it in a psychedelic scene of regeneration.\r\n\r\nToxic Halo is Coates\u2019s first solo show to include an extensive variety of drawings and works on paper, which are integral to her larger paintings. These drawings were completed in the fall at a residency at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in rural Umbria, where she drew the garden and landscape outside her door. A recurring theme is half-human, half-animal hybrids that populate matrices of leaves and branches that break down into passages of color and intricate mark making.\r\n\r\nThe art historical precedents of bathers in the landscape are playfully referenced. Cezanne, Matisse and Picasso are present, but also the tree paintings of Mondrian, and the visionary works of Emily Carr and Charles Burchfield. In this series Coates mystifies the historical, blending it with the contemporary. The works feel both personal and universal and are filled with an eerie pathos.\r\n\r\nJennifer Coates is a painter living and working in New York City and Poyntelle, PA. She received her BFA from University of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and her MFA from Hunter College. She is a recent recipient of the Sharpe Walentas Studio (2018-2019) and was a fellow at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Italy (Fall 2019). Recent solo exhibitions include Correspondences and All U Can Eat (Freight & Volume Gallery) and Carb Load (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts).

His highly detailed paintings have enormous range, both in scale and materiality with meticulous attention to surface, wild inventiveness of patterning, unexpected color harmonies and the presence of exotic plants and creatures in all range of size.\r\nLiu\u2019s work has been described as a celebration of nature and his compassion for the environment is evident as he visually reveals the soul and spirit of his idyllic wildernesses that are joyously free and peaceful in its natural habitat.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years, the subject matter for Liu\u2019s paintings have been about nature. In the previous series of works \u201cFrom Branches They Sing,\u201d it was his wish to direct the viewers to unearth the world of tranquil nature through the use of different painting elements: colors, compositions, textures, dots, and lines. In the \u201cConstellation\u201d series, different creatures on Earth walk, swim, and fly in the cosmos of space. While humans\r\nhave the potential to explore the universe in search of a new planet to migrate, what are the fates of the animals in the future when their homes are polluted and destroyed?\r\nIn this exhibition, Liu continues the ongoing debate about the future habitats for all of the creatures, however beyond the underlying theme of nature, one can sense a profound joy in the materiality of pigment on the surface and the restless search for ever more transformations.

These sayings are seemingly mindless, but they often conjure images and associations in the mind that are specific to our history and society. Shooting the breeze may be absurd as an act, but those words also evoke a range of circumstances and emotions: laziness, violence, and other libertine qualities that inform the world in which we live. That is the idiom\u2019s potency: it exceeds the definitions of language and on top of that, captures the visual and emotional imagination, too.\r\n\r\nIn her work, Marcelja doesn\u2019t directly represent the visual language of idioms, and instead she questions their underlying contexts and histories. Rather than any simple physical representation, the pieces in Shoot the Breeze feel layered, fraught, and absurd. Marcelja\u2019s work questions the sublimated messages we often repeat without any examination.\r\n\r\nIf an eye is for an eye or a tooth for a tooth, what happens in that exchange or transaction?

She has worked in many forms of media such as video, animation and sound, but in recent years rediscovered the humble tools of her early childhood when looking for a magic that seemed lost. She picked up an old set of colored pencils and has not put them down since. Paludanus describes using each color as similar to hearing a musical chord or tasting food - a physical sensation that connects to her memories and dreams - and applies pigments in such dense layers that color becomes an object. In her drawings, combining hard edges and stark shapes with nuanced grades of color and an almost velvet skin, she creates landscapes of a surreal nature that open doors to the unknown spaces within us.\r\n\r\nCara Tomlinson received her B.A. from Bennington College and her M.F.A. from the University of Oregon.

These artists sought to redirect abstract art\u2019s disposition by securing a sense of specificity. Most notably two dominant \u2013 yet not definitive views emerged; these were associated with the young artist/critic, Donald Judd and the older critic, Clement Greenberg. Yet, as we know dominant practices do not develop in isolation, nor are they the product of a single concerted effort or cause. Subsequently, during this period of transition many artists came to work outside what would become the canon of the 1960s.\r\n\r\nWith the great critical divide that rendered the Formalists (color field/ hardedge), Literalists (minimalism), and Neo-Dadaists (Pop) as the art historical canon, the variety of perspectives and critical positions that vied for attention have been lost or forgotten. Specific Form is a sampling of those artists whose works stand beside those of the minimalist, pop, and color-field. As such each of these artists synthesized their own strategies. What is of significant interest at this time is their works also stress the imagistic and optical nature of abstract art. \r\n\r\nFor additional information, images, and press inquires, please contact Anthony Torrano at Anthony@lorettahoward.com", "artforumID": 181916, "showStart": "2020-01-23T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-07T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18076/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Loretta Howard Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Loretta Howard Gallery specializes in classic Post War American art.

Saccoccio is admired for her radiant abstractions and an expanding use of the canvas as a painting tool. Her adventurous body-aware practice and formal concerns align her with contemporary painters recognized for pushing the medium. A recipient of an American Academy in Rome Prize and a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, Saccoccio has exhibited continuously since her White Columns White Room debut in 2001.\r\n\r\nAn allusion to Jean Dubuffet\u2019s \u201cArt Brut,\u201d his definition for raw, emotional work made outside of the academy, Saccoccio\u2019s expansive, physical, and unapologetic Femme Brut is, for what the artist states as \u201cabstraction at full throttle.\u201d The works to go on view are characterized by a muscular urgency and evidence formal interests in space and scale. The unabashed bravado of the newest canvasses recall artist and art critic Thomas Micchelli\u2019s comment that while Saccoccio\u2019s work contains \u201cechoes of Joan Mitchell and Helen Frankenthaler,\u201d it is her \u201cexploitation of every conceivable mode of applying paint\u201d that \u201cgrounds the work in pure painting and distinguishes it as a post-painting phenomenon.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer most recent canvasses, all 2019, are characterized by globules, spheres, washes, and fictitious architecture, which she likens to the \u201cexplosive nature of a tempest,\u201d a reference to Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy that deals with storms, sorcery, and enchantment, such as a pair of epically scaled, highly activated oil and oil pastel on linen paintings measuring 130 x 94 inches. Another work, La Source de la Loue, an oil, oil pastel, and mica on linen measuring 114 x 94 inches, returns to a seminal historical painting for the artist\u2014a ca. 1864 production by the French artist Gustave Courbet of the same title. Saccoccio\u2019s canvas is a buoyant palette to his somber, foreboding tones; she powerfully echoes his cavernous space absent of a horizon line and conveys, terrifyingly, both volume and vacuum. The artist\u2019s monotype paintings also ruminate on this solidity, transparency, and metaphor. The more than six-foot-tall oil and mica on linen Le Puits Noir (Concave)\u2019s layered passages of red, citrus orange, and bone, are like that of a tempest, at once warped and non-sensical and what Saccoccio describes as \u201ca stage for a floating chrysalis.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe artist draws inspiration from art history, contemporary practice, literature, and cinema and is known for an affecting body of chromatic large-scale, body-aware paintings, working in a mode that favors chance, gravity, time and control. She tips, drags, and shakes her paintings over one another, accumulating webs of space, manipulating them as prints, so that one serves as plate, the other as paper. The resulting orbicular centers reflect a conversation between the layers that include atomized color, painted and drawn, perspectival views of pixelation, printmaking, and the results of her alchemical combinations.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated exhibition catalogue with a new essay by Brooklyn-based editor and art critic Julia Wolkoff Fiore.", "artforumID": 181957, "showStart": "2020-01-22T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-14T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18117/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Van Doren Waxter", "galleryDescription": "Van Doren Waxter specializes in modern and contemporary art.

The show highlights Nara\u2019s body of work made between 2015 and 2020 where the artist weaves together kaleidoscopic images of abstracted portraits and self-portraits that illustrate a vivid chronicle of his life between New York and Japan. The result is fresh and highly personal, reading as a visual diary as the artist steps back and forth between localities, ideas, and emotive states.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAkito Nara paints abstract works, evoking the likenesses of creatures, persons, and other forms inspired from personal anecdotes and introspection. Nara's numerous self-portraits exist as interpretations of different facets of his spiritual self. He paints himself to understand his daily existence, his reactions, and his place within his environment. Influenced by organic and cosmic symbolism, Nara uses eyes and colorful deconstructed forms as stylistic anchors and motifs in creating recognizable characters to represent the deepest parts of his subjects and this world.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAkito Nara was born in Yokohama, Japan in 1988.

Beginning on Captiva Island in 2018, as part of the Rauschenberg Residency, Zahar joined fellow visual artists Molly Zuckerman Hartung, Ralph Pugay, Walter Price, Tannaz Farsi, and musician Charlie Rauh for 6 weeks of intensive creation, collaboration, and communion \u2013 with each other, with the natural environment, with the work space energy legacy of an iconic artist, with their own practices and processes of making and being. The initial desire to continue these conversations and to share some of their varied influences and outgrowths with a wider community was the seed of this show.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as seeds planted in fertile soil will do in time under the right conditions, this idea grew. A series of spontaneous conversations between Zahar and poet/publisher Eden Pearlstein in the summer of 2019 presented the opportunity to expand the context of the show to include a more conceptual and poetic dimension. A collection of works meant to commemorate an intensely influential experience slowly but suddenly morphed into a creative reflection on the role of influence upon one\u2019s creative practices and paradigms in general. Poet/Publisher Tom Haviv and Ayin Press were invited to produce a chapbook/catalogue to accompany the show. It was happening again. Encounters, electricity, intuition, openness, In/Flux. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis inspired Zahar to further open up the curatorial field to include conversations he had been having and wanted to facilitate between the socially-engaged and historically-critical works of artists Yevgeniy Fiks and Helina Metaferia. Similarly, around the same time Zahar visited painter Fox Hysen\u2019s studio and rekindled their creative conversations begun a year before when she visited the Rauschenberg residency and completely immersed herself in that environment and community. Whether wrestling with history, language, representation, or technology, each of these artists added a new level of depth to thinking about  how artworks are informed by the past and can transform the future through activating the present. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe multiple modes of thinking and making represented in this show \u2014 including research, ritual, improvisation, ekphrasis, strategy, and serendipity \u2014 all demonstrate the various ways these artists engage their creative practice in relation to their influences and experiences. Taken all together, this collection of works is a snapshot of creative conversations continuing in real time. Come listen in to see what we mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiences. Ideas.

This is Woll\u2019s second solo exhibition with the gallery.\r\n\r\nAndy Woll is best known for his paintings of Mount Wilson, a peak that is identifiable from all over Los Angeles, where Woll lives. His unique approach, informed by research of modernist artists and literary figures, explores the relationship of an abstract artist to a well-known and deeply investigated subject (i.e. a mountain, a horse). \r\n\r\nStrange Animal includes two bodies of landscape painting, both Woll\u2019s most recent Mount Wilson paintings and a newer series that refer to the figure of the horse. The four large mountains are iterations of one another, one with the mountain fully represented and the other three as distinct more abstract versions.  As with the mountain paintings, the horse paintings examine a subject ubiquitous in Woll\u2019s everyday life. However, Woll\u2019s practice is distinctly devoted to repainting the prior painting of a horse, or the prior painting of a mountain, in the studio\u2019s version of a game of telephone. This practice allows him to explore the formal aspects of painting, engendering an identifiable style of bold brush strokes in spare gestures. \r\n\r\nAndy Woll received his B.F.A. from Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles.

Comprised of works made between 1659 and 2019, the works on view were made by early European colonizers in Brazil, modernist Brazilian masters who sought to subvert the vision of said colonizers by building a national artistic language, and contemporary South American artists who reflect on the notion of landscape itself, beyond its political referents.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition features works by Frans Post (Netherlands, 1612-1680), Friedrich Hagedorn (Poland, 1814-1889), Henri Nicolas Vinet (France, 1817-1876), Nicolau Antonio Facchinetti (Italy, 1824-1900), Giovanni Battista Castagneto (Italy, 1851-1900), Tarsila do Amaral (Brazil, 1886-1973), Alberto da Veiga Guignard (Brazil, 1896-1962), Alfredo Volpi (Italy, 1896-1988), Amadeo Luciano Lorenzato (Brazil, 1900-1995), Jose Pancetti (Brazil, 1902-1958), Miguel Bakun (Brazil, 1909-1963), and H\u00e9lio Melo (Brazil, 1926-2001).

The work of the European painters who traveled to Brazil is a reminder that to paint is also to colonize. Prior to the mid 20th century, beyond its coastal cities, Brazil was still mostly uncolonized and inhabited by indigenous and runaway enslaved peoples. Painting was a way of domesticating the continent\u2019s frontier. Their work, placed against that of contemporary artists, invites reflections on the ways in which we relate to landscapes today, both geopolitically and psychologically.

When violet is present in large areas, it can be distinctly terrifying\u2026Violet is the hue of piety, and when darkened and dulled, a dark superstition. Lurking catastrophe burst forth from dark violet. Once it is lightened, when light and understanding illuminate dark piety, delicate and lovely tints enchant us\u2026Chaos, death, and exultation in violet, solitude, and dedication in blue-violet, divine love and spiritual dominion in red-violet. Many plants have light violet shoots, with yellow centers.\r\n\r\nFor Itten, purple contains a powerful expressive force that ranges from the menacing to the divine. While certain association with the color, as with any color, can arguably be universally generalized, the artists in Purple are banded together in order to exemplify the color\u2019s subjective dimension. The associations with purple, and its incorporation into the various artworks displayed herein, range widely in terms of expression and emotion, tint and shade, deeply personal and mainstream cultural, ancient and modern, queer, noble, liminal, magical, and moody.", "artforumID": 182955, "showStart": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-22T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id19115/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Underdonk", "galleryDescription": "Underdonk is an artist run collective dedicated to showcasing emerging and established artists.", "address": "1329 Willoughby Ave #211", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 11237", "lng": -73.920871563789, "lat": 40.706360416602, "hours": "Sat - Sun 1pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "underdonk.com", "galleryEmail": "info@underdonk.com", "phone": "3472515556", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.915Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.915Z"}, {"id": 249, "title": "Christopher Wilmarth: Sculpture and Drawings from the 1970s", "description": null, "artforumID": 182056, "showStart": "2020-01-30T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-14T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18216/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Normal Drawing, 1971, Etched glass and steel cable, 22 x 22 x 3&#8260;4 inches, private collection, courtesy Craig F.

A Feeling Falls Apart is a group exhibition with works by Paolo Arao, Jeanine Oleson, Kristine Woods, and Sun You, curated by Poppy DeltaDawn. \r\n\r\n Feeling, a verb, is also a noun. Many English speakers understand that adding the -ing suffix to a word can denote action, but to add -ing can also form a verbal noun. Sewing Machine, Jumping Jack, A Reaping .  A Feeling is a thing that helps us to interpret the world around us. Cognitive and emotional reactions form what our brains understand to be reality. What happens though, when our brains switch feelings rapidly? When a feeling turns into another feeling? When a thought becomes a feeling? What happens when a feeling falls apart?\r\n\r\nSun You presents a new paneled work, dotted with a landscape of fragmented forms above a watercolored floral scene. Also featured is a modest wire sculpture held together with magnets and pins on a plinth. A delicate balancing act, the arrangement of wires and found objects recall ikebana, or kothkoji (flower arrangement). Similarly, the operatives in Paolo Arao's stitched and stretched fabric canvases come together in a seductive composition that float between formal abstraction and material. \"Imperfections\" in the work present themselves as exposed seams and quavering geometries.\r\n\r\nJeanine Oleson\u2019s two included works, Can you feel it? and Xallarap explore sensory communication of sound, sight and touch scaling the body to the larger world. Oleson\u2019s work uses materials like copper and a conch shell to make these connections, finding ways to transmit through conduction and illusion. \r\n\r\nKristine Woods brings a new sculpture and prints to A Feeling Falls Apart, along with papier-mache works from her Stanza series. Over Sleeping Lips, Woods' new sculpture comprised of felted sheep's wool, is held aloft by a twelve foot stake spanning the ceiling. Installed in the gallery's storefront window, it steps with the foot traffic of the Bowery and recalls the founding steps of the legendary throughway.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRespectively, this group of artists represents feeling in atrophy and on the brink of collapse, and in this stage, new and expansive feelings are formed. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPaolo Arao is a Brooklyn-based, Filipino-American artist working in painting and textiles.

While the boxes are recognizable mass produced items, when collected and arranged typologically, the diversity in print design becomes radically clear, raising questions about regional pizza box distributors, how imagery is used in packaging design, the convergence of high and low art, and pizza, which everyone has an opinion about.\r\n\r\nWhile McMahon has been overshadowed by the success of his fellow Pictures Generation artists such as Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, and Cindy Sherman, his most recognizable artworks, which were included in a 2009 Pictures Generations show at the NY Met, are his pastels on newspapers and text on postcards from the Nixon era. In the late 1980s, McMahon removed ads and PSAs from the NYC subway, carefully obscured the text with paint (in a pre-Photoshop gesture) to reveal a pure image, and returned the ads to their original contexts. Performative and punk, actions such as these are the most similar to McMahon\u2019s current work on pizza boxes. By filling in spaces with colored marker, merging elements of the image with similar colors, and painting over text, McMahon alters the scenes to create unique landscapes that feel familiar yet disconcerting, such as Rome\u2019s Coliseum being flooded, a town enveloped by an apocalyptic sky, or a charming cafe scene with an unfurled Russian flag.\r\n\r\nPaul McMahon (b. 1950, San Diego, CA) is a musician, artist, writer, producer, curator, minister, and part-time mailman. His work spans painting, sculpture, video, musical recordings, and works on paper. In the early 1970s, McMahon began organizing exhibitions, parties, and rock shows in Cambridge, MA and New York City, playing a vital role in bringing together artists in the post-Conceptual and pre-Pictures generation. During the 1970s, McMahon created a diverse body of work addressing corruption in government, the art world, and pictures themselves. In later decades, he continued producing work as live performances and video, satirizing politicians and the advertising world, often from a shamanic orientation.\r\n\r\nFrom 1972-75, he organized over 30 conceptual and performance art shows at Project Inc., his independently run temporary art space in Cambridge, MA. He has played in bands such as Daily Life (with Glenn Branca, Barbara Ess, and Christine Hahn) and A Band, performed parodic routines in shows such as I\u2019m With Stupid at the Kitchen (1977), and duelled one-liner jokes dressed as a giant potato on national TV against Soupy Sales. McMahon has released ten albums of original music, published two books of humor, and performed as the Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Therapist since 1980. He received a fellowship in New Genres from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1990 and the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College acquired the Project Inc. archive in 2010. McMahon graduated with a BA in Fine Art from Pomona College in 1972 and received an MS in Art Education from MassArt in 1975. He is the proprietor of the Mothership, an everything center in Woodstock, NY.\r\n\r\nRecent solo shows include Eye Heart Unicorn at 9 Herkimer Place (Brooklyn, NY); Me at 3A Gallery (New York, NY); and 44 at 321 Gallery (Brooklyn, NY). McMahon\u2019s work has been exhibited in select group shows such as Innocence at Super Dutchess Gallery (New York, NY); Points of Light in a Nocturnal World at 7 Herkimer Place (Brooklyn, NY); Stairway to Heaven at Susan Inglett Gallery (New York, NY); All Suffering Soon To End! at Callicoon Fine Arts Gallery (Callicoon, NY); The Pictures Generation, 1974-1984, curated by Douglas Eklund at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, NY); and The White Room at White Columns (New York, NY).", "artforumID": 182297, "showStart": "2020-02-09T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-16T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18457/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Coliseum Yellows, 2018", "gallery": "321 Gallery", "galleryDescription": "321 Gallery is an artist-run space located on the garden level of a residential brownstone in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.", "address": "321 Washington Avenue\nGarden Level", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 11205", "lng": -73.96562205, "lat": 40.689210663654, "hours": "Sat 12pm to 5pm", "galleryURL": "www.321gallery.org", "galleryEmail": "321@321gallery.org", "phone": "+17189300493", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.875Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.875Z"}, {"id": 277, "title": "\"We Are Hesitant to Serve You\"", "description": "Javier Mayoral's oddly seductive and sarcastic pieces, on view at the The Storefront Project, 1/30-2.22", "artforumID": 182314, "showStart": "2020-01-30T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18474/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "The Storefront Project", "galleryDescription": "The Storefront Project&#8203; showcases art and other programming influenced by pop culture and advertising via our storefront space in the LES.", "address": "70 Orchard Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10002", "lng": -73.99031875, "lat": 40.717483963668, "hours": "Tue - Sun 1pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "storefrontproject.com", "galleryEmail": "g@storefrontproject.com", "phone": "+16463192220", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.876Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.876Z"}, {"id": 280, "title": "CULT OF THE CRIMSON QUEEN", "description": "Ceysson & B\u00e9n\u00e9ti\u00e8re is pleased to present Cult of the Crimson Queen, curated by Michelle Segre. Featuring works by Sarah Braman, Amy Brener, Sedrick Chisom, Kari Cholnoky, Joy Curtis, Nikita Gale, Naotaka Hiro, Michael Mahalchick, Sarah Peters, and Jennifer Sirey, this exhibition will be on view from February 5th through March 14th, 2020. \r\n\r\nCult of the Crimson Queen builds upon allusions to cult iconography, ritual practices, and music festivals to propose art as a healing force and palliative to the psychic and material toxicity of the Anthropocene era.  The show addresses the connection between mind, body, and environment while also acknowledging the possible ominous implications of collective thinking. Works in the exhibition cultivate a sense of DIY and supernatural intervention, evoking the remnants of a ceremonial action.  Found objects, natural materials, as well as seemingly toxic synthetic compounds come together to suggest an ancient-future landscape being rebuilt after a pending ecological collapse.\r\n\r\nEach artist in the show viscerally engages the viewer.  In Nikita Gales\u2019s sound piece, Keynote Drift, a trumpet imitates the sounds of car horns to create a plaintive, otherworldly raga that channels the breath of the human body while signaling what could be a siren of alarm.  Amy Brener\u2019s Flexi-Shields hang like apparitions of a future civilization of self-sufficient Earth-Goddess worshippers, equipped with Q-tips, paperclips and flowers.  Likewise, Joy Curtis\u2019 fabric and steel skeletal forms, delicately dyed with natural pigments, employ gravity to hang like flamboyant costumes awaiting use in a ritualized dance.  A dance is further evoked in the pigmented bronze of Naotaka Hiro, an artist who literally positions his body inside his medium to capture the action of the self, manipulating his material from within, whether it be a canvas or a mold of silicon, plaster and wax.  The result is a work in which the artist appears to be a shaman to his own subconscious; shamanistic and devotional tendencies come together in the works of performance artist and sculptor Michael Mahalchick, whose defaced and collaged rock posters and albums possess a comically unhinged aura further magnified in the assortment of latex face masks that recall the terrifying energy of the throng.  Sarah Peters\u2019 mysterious female head summons the sectarians of a secret society while collapsing the linearity of time through her re-imagining of an ancient icon form that feels so precisely of our present era.  Magic and the supernatural meld together with the ghosts of a dark and foreboding history in the paintings on paper of Sedrick Chisom, whose work could also be seen as a conjuring of a future planet, where the living walk amongst the spirits of the past.  The shockingly flesh-like growths in the vitrines of Jennifer Sirey are actually living bacteria cultivated through a combination of wine and acetobacter, otherwise known, somewhat poetically, as \u201cmother of vinegar.\u201d  The tenderly fetishized, acidly colored surfaces of Kari Cholnoky\u2019s paintings, three-dimensional constructions made from an assortment of collaged materials like faux-fur, cotton bandages, and foam feel like a new species come-to-life from a churning stew of chemical waste.  Lastly, the artist Sarah Braman employs a formalist approach to the re-purposing of found objects, specifically those pieces of furniture or car or tree that suggest the ritualized acts of every-day life that bring family and friends together or provide solace to the lone individual\u2014 eating, reading, sleeping, connecting with nature\u2014 the essence of what ultimately saves our sanity\r\n\r\nMichelle Segre (b. 1965) lives and works in New York, NY.

The show features ceramics, mixed-media sculptures, and paintings on canvas. The opening reception will be on Thursday, February 6, from 6-8 PM at 56 Bogart Street in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\nThe title is an oblique reference to the passing of time and its inevitable influence on the process of creativity. A character in Tennessee Williams\u2019 1944 play The Glass Menagerie states, \u201cI didn't go to the moon, I went much further--for time is the longest distance between places.\u201d Although it is not visible in the works, time is ever-present through an awareness of its scarcity and that there can be no distance traversed without its expense. The pseudo-functional mixed media sculptures, conceptual ceramics, and layered paintings reveal how process is deep-rooted in time.\r\n\r\nAbrahamsson and Bod\u00e9n both use ceramics in their work and are intimately familiar with relinquishing control to time in the processes of drying, firing, and glazing, often repeatedly, before a piece looks right. Time is equally important to Swan who sometimes spends months on an individual painting. Adding layer by layer of paint, each new coat becomes a guide for the next as he works his way to a solution. In this way, time itself becomes a vital conduit: a transmitter of ideas, clues, and consequences.\r\n\r\nBod\u00e9n, who in the past made functional ceramics, is frequently asked how long it takes to make one cup, mug or bowl. Her response: \u201csomething like 25 years.\u201d Today she makes highly textured sculptures that are stacks of skillfully wheel-thrown ceramics that turn the idea of functional ware to precariously balance on its head. Similarly, Swan\u2019s recent works explore the possibilities of masking and layering with increased levels of complexity. Over time, his paintings incorporate more layers and techniques: a slow process of incremental and purposeful painterly considerations that are palpable to the viewer in each work. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbrahamsson mixes hand-built ceramic objects with synthetic matter, such as latex belts and PVC pipes. Her sculptures visually echo the linear nature of Swan\u2019s painting and the vertical arrangement of Bod\u00e9n\u2019s stacks. Abrahamsson\u2019s sculptures have shapes that allude to function and which delight in material tension. Choreographed into groups, her objects become stationary conductors that help navigate viewers through multiple meanings of time and space. \r\n\r\nIrja Bod\u00e9n works in many media; ceramics are at the core of her work.  Presently on exhibit at the Konstmuseet i Norr, Sweden, Amos Eno Gallery will host a solo show of her work in September 2020. Irja grew up north of the Arctic Circle in Sweden, and received her BFA from the State University of New York in 2006.  She is a recipient of several residencies and grants, to include ones from the New York State Council on the Arts and the Vermont Studio Center.  Her studio is in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley.\r\n\r\nMalin Abrahamsson is an inter-disciplinary artist deeply fascinated by material and existential transformation. The recipient of several residencies, grants, and awards, her work has been exhibited in and around New York and abroad. She has completed a number of public commissions, most recently a Percent for Art commission at PS 377Q in Queens, awarded by NYC Department of Culture and Public Art for Public Schools. Born and raised in northern Sweden, Malin received her BFA with an honorable mention from The School of Visual Arts in 1998. She now lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\nPhilip Swan is a self-taught painter who has been showing at Amos Eno Gallery since 2018. He has a BA and MSI from the University of Michigan and an MA from the College of William and Mary. He is originally from Michigan and has lived in New York since 1997.

To his contemporaries, however\u2014figures such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Rousseau, Oscar Wilde, and Guillaume Apollinaire\u2014Jarry\u2019s prestige extended beyond theater. He applied his genius to poetry, the novel, and operettas; he was a graphic artist, an actor, a puppeteer, a critic, and the inventor of an imaginary science called pataphysics. For Jarry, engagements with technology, popular imagery, and the performance of everyday life could constitute works of art.\r\n\r\nSome of the many ideas and innovations he brought to multiple mediums also found expression in his maverick book and magazine designs. Jarry was one of the first writers to experiment with visual typography.

The concept of granting property owners the right to construct floor area above the normally permitted maximum if they set aside public open space on their private property was first introduced with the adoption of the comprehensive zoning overhaul of 1961. The most common type of POPS in North America is the corporate-controlled plaza, park or atrium provided in exchange for a floor area ratio (FAR) bonus. Nowhere in America is there more POPS then in New York, and nowhere in New York are there more POPS then Midtown Manhattan, and nowhere in Midtown Manhattan is there a more magnificent POPS the on fifth avenue inbetween Tiffany\u2019s and Bonwitt Teller.\r\n\r\nWhen *__ walked through it\u2019s golden arched revolving doors on January 16, 1995, she was overwhelmed with indescrible wonder at the aesthetics of it\u2019s splendor. A doorman stood outside next to a sign that read: Atrium open every day from 8am to 10pm, greeting prospective entrees. Her mother nodded at him as they passed into the bright and airy passage leading to the escalators. *__ stopped walking to stare at him. The oversized brass buttons on his uniform and his immaculate white gloves reminded her of a person in an old movie or a cartoon, wordlessly discouraging unwanted guests through the authority his implied status. He smiled at her and mouthed through the glass: Hello. She smiled back.\r\n\r\nHer mother had been planning on going to Tiffany\u2019s, but decided at the last moment to go to the Waterfall Cafe instead. That morning she had carefully began to prepare for this trip from her apartment in Central Queens to Midtown Manhattan. She applied blue eyeshadow, carefully sweeping upward instead of sideways. Then she had taken a tweezer and plucked the small hairs from her formally thick eyebrows, away from what was now two thin, elegant arches. Her brow was very small and there was virtually no hood over the eyes, making them appear enormous even without makeup. Two heavily notched nostrils that curved downward in a strongly defined tip had generated certain comparisons to Sophia Loren, but her overall physical presence was so nondescript she seemed to disintegrate within a crowd. Her platinum blonde hair had been modestly braided in past, but now she wore a contemporary, shoulder length style based off of a photo of Mariah Carey that she had cut out of magazine. Then she put on a pair of jeans from Levis, a white sweater with a swan knitted in mohair and a brand new pair of sneakers and the transformation was complete.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Walk next to me. This is the last time I am telling you this. I am fed up with looking for you everywhere\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nThey stepped onto a glistening escalator, one of many that moved tourists and workers of the fifth avenue retail district among the different levels of the atrium, and descended down to the Waterfall Cafe. The space was massive, rising at least 30 feet or higher, with the waterfall taking up the bulk of attention. The entire aspace was covered in Breccia Perniche marble, but the vertical stacked stabs where the running water flowed downward to the pool seemed to glow with their own luminosity, like a constellation of stars. Smartly dressed couples, groups, and singles mingled inbetween small metal tables and ficus trees. Grandiose flower arrangements had been placed adventurously on the still on the waterfall\u2019s pool and near the mouth of the escalator in imitation Chinese vases.\r\n\r\n*__ ran to the edge of pool. Small pennies glittered beneath the rippling of moving water. Under the original 1961 regulations, many of the most basic amenities, such as trees, lighting, and seating, were prohibited within the plaza area. There were minimal requirements overseeing plaza location, configuration, and safety. Additionally, POPS could be utilized for loading, parking, vehicular circulation, trash removal and building maintenance activities. 166 plazas were constructed pursuant to the 1961 regulations before amendments were introduced in 1975, resulting in the production of what was essentially transient landscapes of concrete and asphalt isolated from public view. Post-reform spaces therefore thrived over their pre-reform compatriots like a phoenix rising from the ashes, with of such amenities such as bathrooms, lighting, food carts and caf\u00e9s, art, seating and other design amenities encouraging use and integration.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of a handsomely manicured ficus tree was touching *__\u2019s face. She reached over and touched it with the tip of her finger. Somewhere far away a song was playing, a gentle piano arrangement with cascading synths fading in and out of the background. In this unspeakably beautiful and mysterious place fertile with life and teeming with the potential of an infinite number of possibilities, she felt an subliminal joy fill her heart. This was the place she had been waiting to see her entire life and she had been given the privilege bestowed to very few: the privilege of being accepted as a guest. A small space in the heart of the Waterfall Cafe that had been allotted just for her- only as passive onlooker for now, but maybe in the future...\r\n\r\n*__ did not notice immediately that her mother had left. When she did she began frantically looking at the different figures passing by, trying to locate the platinum blonde curls, or grey sweater and jeans, but she was really gone. She had made good on her promise: she was sick and tired of looking for her bratty kid. The sounds of the people suddenly intensified all around her and became overwhelming. Everything was changing so rapidly. People were everywhere: laughing, eating, taking photos, working, fighting over seating, thousands of bodies moving rapidly through the atrium with a million different desires and needs. There was no reason in ruining the mood with her sadness. She walked to the escalator and descended down to the basement level.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe last step opened up to another marbled hallway running parallel to the staircase to the right, to the retail entrance of a Tower Records; a large floor-to-wall mirror created a dead end adjacent to the left, and directly across two bathrooms had been built with open door archways that had little figurines bolted to the frame visually explaining their function to the prospective visitor. The quiet shuffle of loafers was the only sound as two girls with Tower Records shopping bags exited the bathrooms and immediately ascended back up to the plaza level.\r\n\r\nThe floral wallpaper inside was so old and washed out it was almost invisible. \r\n\r\nBy linking the retail space that circled the atrium to the protected fifth avenue subdistrict outside, the building was able receive a additional zoning bonus for 105,436 square feet. It had also received bonuses for building a mixed use building. The building has generated other ways to create it\u2019s own money: In 1983, a state supreme court justice directed that New York City grant a multimillion dollar tax abatement to the building (this program was set up to facilitate the transformation of under-utilized property into low-income housing). The management and construction wing, owned by real estate developer of the property, collects an undisclosed sum in management every month. The commission from the sale of 42 luxury apartments has generated $11 million for his . By buying the air rights over Tiffany\u2019s next door for $5 Million, these apartments are guaranteed to offer sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the Tower Records was the entrance to a small, poorly lite descending staircase. It was clearly not part of the atrium and lacked any lighting, signage or marking to distinguish it or attract foot traffic. A plastic flower arrangement had been placed as an afterthought on the third of the cheap linoleum steps. This was the clearly the delineation point of the POPS, where the mediocrity of ordinary life began again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was in fact a lounge: probably once an after-hours spot, it had clearly been taken out of commission, possible for good until it was gutted. The odor of mold and water damage was immediately present. An old bar was directly next to the foot of the staircase had been stripped down to the skeleton; only the clear lucite barstools and black countertop remained, curving around the righthand corner to form a pseudo-triangle. The whole room was furnished in sculpted mauve carpeting in a floor-to-wall style covering in innumerable stains and discolorations. Recessed seating areas of the kind that had once been in vogue during the 70s pocketed the floor in random clusters like geometrically shaped craters, large underground squares with wood paneled floors descending downward a single carpeted step that also doubled as seating. The old green and yellow neon strip lights that snaked over the empty liqueur display were on despite the place having been abandoned years ago- it seemed they were connected to some other lightening system, and she shuddered to think that someone was unknowingly activating this deserted space everytime they turned on the lights in the retail or atrium.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the right wall, a short podium held the only above ground seating: an series of puffy, water stained brown leather loveseats and a few of primitive side tables.\r\n\r\nAn old issue of playboy was shoved underneath a broken barstool. The base of the stool was pressed over a picture of Maria Scheinder, holding a wine glass as though to offer a prospective guest a drink. She had posed for the magazine in 1973. In the center of the room a horribly rusty metal chandelier had become a conduit for a slow drip of water. The janitor\u2019s bucket that had been placed to catch the drops had long been filled and the stain under it was clearly spreading it all directions. Parts of the carpet on the ceiling had fallen off from water damage and were hanging in curled orange peel shapes like blossoming flower opening around the chandelier chain.\r\n\r\nNext to the old hand operated POS system was the bare outline of a small service door, semi camouflaged by the pink carpeting. Inside a small bar kitchen, long out of service, was the clutter of metal chairs, plastic flower arrangements, and other items from the magnificent waterfall cafe.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA hand written sign that read \u201c No exit - return upstairs\u201d on old typewriter paper was taped to the door at the end. The translucent yellow cellulose was covered in little spots of mold. Thousands of dead insects created psychedelic light designs, stretched out in little cylinders and and dots on the walls and floor. The sound of a radio could be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nShe opened the door. The room beneath it was enormous, at least 4 times larger then the previous floor, with a single abnormally high north facing window that was almost touching the ceiling. The rays of the setting sun barely provided enough light to bring the tops of the wood paneled walls into focus while a monstrous junk pile of material culture laid in almost total darkness. A yellowed plastic bubble chair with the seat cushion ripped out had been repurposed to store a garish golden candelabra covered with the disembodied wings and torsos of fat baby cherubs. An old blue shag carpet was dragged over the body of decorative japanese panel, a blown up image of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s smiling face embossed over the front in black and white newsprint. The matted fibers had clung to the surface, staining her cheeks and lips green in some freak act of illicit chemistry.\r\n\r\nStacks of mirrors with imitation spanish frames leaned against retired Eames chairs, mushroom lamps and grandfather clocks, slicing and remixing reality with their vacant reflections. Clusters of decorative figurines in every variation were haphazardly stored on every available flat surface, from porcelain clowns to metal lions, stretching backwards into the recesses of the room until it became impossible to see how many there were in dark staring back at the entrance of their netherworld. A set of green melamine teacups and saucers were stacked on top of an ancient luxor wooden television set from the 1950s. It had become warped and hunchbacked with age, and the every nock and corner was encrusted with with a revolting layer of black dust so thick it looked like little tufts of fur. Despite this the set seemed seemed oddly suspended in motion, still usable, as though it was patiently waiting for someone to give it a good wipe down and the years could simply wash away, the old sights and sounds could come back again.\r\n\r\nThe excess of retired things seemed to stretch on indefinitely in every direction. Boxy record players that closed like briefcases for easy transportation, never used picture frames with old sample photos of John Lennon still inside, lifeless deflated macram\u00e9 throw pillows, a heavily dusted snowglobe from the Met Cloisters with a barely visible unicorn inside, a cracked teapot pointed stoically at a small bronze figurine of the World Trade center, a Patrick Nagel print of a woman holding a black rabbit that said \u201cPlayboy March 1982\u201d that looked like it was emitting silent scream. In the background, the invisible radio continued to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nA witch was sitting there, in almost complete darkness, illuminated only by the ambient glow of the north window. She was hunched over a recreation tudor style writing table, facing toward the west wall, polishing a red glass ball about the size of a orange. Only one of her hands moved, slowly pushing a tightly clenched rag back and forth across the ball\u2019s surface with such force that it trembled. The sudden flood of cheap florescent light from the hallway exposed her, the skin of her arms and shoulders radiating like the smooth plastic of a mannequin while tiny diamond earring exploded aggressively into white fragments of light. The newly formed shadow of a massive mahogany armoire made contact with her face at the jawline, violently breaking her short wavy hair into two halves of black and reddish-brown. She was vaguely ugly in that special way only russian woman were ugly: her features were a fleshy, ageless blur, something meditterean or maybe caucasian or asiatic, as incomprehensible as the thousand year old contours of a phareonic statuette. \r\n\r\nShe stood up, her right hand remaining at the table, as the shadow of the armoire dropped down to her elbows. Her fingertips spread over the glass ball to hold it in place.\r\n\r\n\u201c ...Today is January 16th, 1995. My opinion is that he will be from outer space. And he will be a creature, a powerful demon, scary to the human eye. Very very fearful. I believe he will either be from another galaxy, an invasion of earth from another planets, either in our galaxy or another galaxy, that the earth will be in captivity. It\u2019ll be a time when even the most religious will say where is God?.... It was bad enough before this. But now the earth has been captivated by other aliens from other planets...\u201c\r\n\r\nShe rolled the ball across the table until it reached the edge, reaching over with her other hand to catch it in her open palm. She then turned away from the door and began to walk into the receded shadows, vanishing behind a plastic art deco style mirror that doubled as a hanger for a crumbling fox pelt. The radio abruptly cut off.\r\n\r\n*__ looked at the fox. It was the only thing in room with what could be called a face and it\u2019s small mouth had rotted and collapsed into the downturned grimace of an old man waiting to die. The final embers of the sun colored the northern window and it\u2019s old, deformed frame, igniting the old dusty flecks of peeling paint for the last time. If she had come here with her father maybe he would have come back. Maybe he would come for her and she could still go home.\r\n\r\nThe witch returned, her palms outstretched in front her, displaying a small hand mirror. She smiled and a gold crown on the left canine flickered. \u201cI want to give you something\u201d, she said. \u201cLet tell you some things...\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nLet me tell you something:\r\nThis mirror doesn\u2019t reflect people, with all their flaws and fatalities - only the exosomatic tools of our civilization. This mirror creates Apathy, Hypocrisy, and Self-Rightious Moralization. In this mirror you can see the movements and actions of human beings as they alter the world and it alters them in a circular, symbiotic relationship, but you will never have to experience them directly again. Even you can disappear - turn it towards\r\nyourself and you will see the soul has been separated from the body.\r\n\r\nEvery human being is nothing more then a single cell in a body of millions, moving through the motions of a greater purpose, awesome forces invisible to them. Sadness, regret, loss, despair- these should be the fleeting emotions of only the most underdeveloped toddler at the very beginning of their life. But when I think about death\r\nand see a woman\u2019s beauty, like your mother\u2019s, created by God in his own image, lying in the grave, ugly, abject, shriveled, it\u2019s physical form destroyed- I am filled with unbearable grief. How have we been given over to this corruption?\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\nYou taught yourself how to speak with your own voice,\r\nYou taught yourself your name,\r\nNo one helped you.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you something:\r\nYour name could be Kristina, or as others say, Irina. Your name could be Yelena, or as others say, Svetlana. Your name could be Yulia. Your name could be Zoya. Your name could also Tamara, or as others say, Daria. Your name could be Viktoria, your name could be Nadezhda, or as some say, Natalia. Your name could Xenia, but your name could also be Dina. Your name could be Maya...You could be anyone. You could be love with anything...\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\nYou leveled this flattened, monocolored land\r\nEtched in the pale ragged freckles,\r\nSmoothed out the gray half moons under your black eyes,\r\nYou chiseled the red cracks of your bloodshot pupils,\r\nGerminated the rows of waxy red hairs with your tears,\r\nCrafted the twisted groves of green veins,\r\nSculpted the upturned piggish nose\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\nIlluminated by the olive-yellow light of a single deformed star\r\nA bare tree rises over the frost-molded tundra\r\na single rusty nail protrudes from it\u2019s trunk,\r\na formless, colorless scrap of paper still hangs there\r\nno leaves have grown there for many years\r\nspiders have cultivated harvests of glistening dewdrops in between it\u2019s limbs\r\nNo one can contaminate you with their lust\r\nNo one can subjugate you with their love\r\nIn this graveyard even the most feveront desire withers away\r\nEven the most exceptional explorer eventually abandons ship\r\n\r\nConsider This:\r\nHow old is this expanse? How has it changed over time?\r\nLethargy with be your weapon, Mediocrity will be your shield. No one will change you.\r\nYou\u2019ll always stay the same\r\nBeyond this day\r\nJanuary 16, 1995\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nFaina Brodsky is a New York-based artist working in drawing and visual narration.

The show extends from January 28th to February 15th with an opening reception on Thursday, January 30th, 6-8PM and a closing party on Saturday, February 15th, 4\u20136pm.\r\nThe web tells us that the top 5 related words for \"members only\" are: closed shop, exchange, exclusive, just, and private. And yes, this exhibition is devoted exclusively to artists who are committed to creating and sharing their work as it grows & progresses.\r\nViridian Artists have always prided themselves on being open to a wide variety of art styles, disciplines and media. We are not focused on realism or abstraction, nor do we favor painters over collagists or photographers over sculptors. Our current stable of artists reflects these diversities with pride and curiosity. \r\nIt\u2019s not often at Viridian that only members\u2019 work is shown for we often invite guest artists: some we know, some we are just getting to know. But this time, it\u2019s Members Only! Some are new to us like Frances Vye Wilson who creates fascinating garment and plant-like sculptural structures of natural fibers from the East. And the photographers Marco Lando & Pavel Muller whose works are vastly different: Lando\u2019s filled with emotional overtones & Muller\u2019s cool and graphic.\r\nPhotographers Robert Smith and Alan Gaynor also see the world uniquely. Gaynor\u2019s images often architectural, make us conscious of the lines of beauty in buildings and Smith notices the minutia of life, like the soft breeze through an open window. In a totally different vein, Angela Smith & Srividya Ramachandran both work with digital photography, but Ramachandran has created her own AI who makes images while Angela Smith explores drawing on her photographic self-portraits. Wally Gilbert transforms his digital photographs by breaking them down into colors and shapes whose beginnings are barely recognizable.  \r\nViridian artists who are primarily painters include Bob Tomlinson, Henry Coupe, Yu Huang, Bruce Rosen, Toto Takamori, Virginia Smit and John Neiman. Each have their unique approach to technique & subject matter. Coupe\u2019s paintings are small and gestural portraits, Tomlinson\u2019s theatrical with collaged elements, Takamori\u2019s with layers and layers paint that takes months to dry and Huang\u2019s paintings are realistic explorations of history. Bruce Rosen\u2019s abstract paintings are akin to meditations while John Neiman mixes a fascination of art and popular culture in his paintings. Virginia Smit has explored a wide variety of printmaking techniques and mixes her prints with collage, drawing & paintings that often focus on nature.\r\nSculptors Kat King and Ron Moore both work in metal but King casts most of her work from sculptural maquettes while Moore welds and paints his steel figures. Maki Hajikano\u2019s glass abstractions come from another sculptural world.\r\nMixed media artists May DeViney, Ellen Burnett, Kiffi Diamond all work with found objects, each uniquely transforming discards and fragments into compositions that are their private interpretations of reality, sometimes with psychological overtones and frequently with humor. \r\nAnd there are the mixed media artists Susan Sills, Bernice Faegenburg, Renee Borkow and Kazuo Ishikawa who might be considered primarily painters but Sills paints on wood cutouts, Borkow and Faegenburg mix in collage with their drawing and painting. Differently, Kazuo Ishikawa creates his assemblages of cut bits of color in plastic and metal which he calls \u201cconstructive layered painting\u201d.\r\nViridian has begun a number of programs to give more artists an opportunity to show their art. Our Young Artist program is for artists who are under thirty years of age & I the early stages of their careers. Last year we offered one young artist, Ana Guraieb Chahin, who weaves her art, a Barbara K Schwartz scholarship. Sarah Jarrett and Gentry Park, both young painters, explore personal themes in their work.\r\nAnd \u201clast but not least\u201d, are Viridian\u2019s Alumni Artists, Deborah Sudran, Dorothy Braudy and Carol Brookes who were once fully represented by the gallery. Though they no longer are, they continue to participate in group shows.\r\nWe look forward to sharing exciting new works by these outstanding Viridian Artists.\r\n\r\nGallery hours: Tuesday through Saturday 12\u20136pm\r\nFor further information please contact Vernita Nemec, Gallery Director at 212-414-4040 or viridianartistsinc@gmail.com \r\nor view the gallery website: www.viridianartists.com", "artforumID": 182209, "showStart": "2020-01-28T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-15T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18369/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Kazuo Ishikawa  \u201cEndless Game\u201d 15 x 21 inches, Mixed Media", "gallery": "Viridian Artists", "galleryDescription": "Viridian Artists founded in 1968 is one of the longest running artist-owned art galleries in NY.", "address": "548 West 28th Street\n6th Floor", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10001", "lng": -74.0041872, "lat": 40.751566113684, "hours": "Tue - Sat 12pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "viridianartists.com", "galleryEmail": "viridianartistsinc@gmail.com", "phone": "+12124144040", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.874Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.874Z"}, {"id": 268, "title": "PORTRAITS", "description": "Catherine Murphy - Terry Winters: \r\nPORTRAITS \r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 1 - April 10, 2020\r\nIowa City\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970s, after his final descent into near-blindness, Jorge Luis Borges drew a self-portrait for Burt Britton in the basement of the Strand Bookstore in New York City. The result, a cluster of lines, was published in 1976 in The Paris Review upside down. Which direction it was meant to be seen, we can\u2019t be sure\u2026.\r\n\r\nA definition of a portrait could be a depiction of a likeness. A reflection. In the same way that an echo is a reflection of sound that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. \r\nThe word echo derives from the Greek &#967;&#974; (&#275;ch&#333;), itself from &#7974;&#967;&#959;&#962; (&#275;chos), \"sound\".\r\nIn fine art, a portrait can be a sculpture, a painting, a form of photography or any other representation of a person, in which the face is the main theme. Traditional easel-type portraits usually depict the sitter head-and-shoulders, half-length, or full-body.\r\n\r\nThe oldest know portrait is of a woman, sculpted from mammoth ivory during the last ice age around 26,000 years ago. \r\n \r\nThis show is about two artists and two different ways of approaching portraiture.\r\n\r\nCatherine Murphy\u2019s self-portraits from the 1970\u2019s are classical depictions of the artist in her studio.\r\nTerry Winters\u2019 drawings visualize information, reminding us of the new facial recognition systems used to identify a singular person.\r\n\r\nCorinthians 13:12 \r\nFor now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatherine Murphy was born in 1946 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nTerry Winters was born in 1949 in Brooklyn, NY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Exemplar Gallery   \tIowa City IA 52245   \t by appointment only\r\n\r\nthenationalexemplar@gmail.com   \t         thenationalexemplargallery.com", "artforumID": 182290, "showStart": "2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-04-10T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18450/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "The National Exemplar Gallery", "galleryDescription": "The National Exemplar Gallery specializes in contemporary art.

His latest exhibition at Metro Pictures concerns, among other things, a sense of everyday malaise and life's petty annoyances. It features a series of large-format photographs, two installations, and a video work titled Toll Free.\r\n\r\nMannequins are an iconic theme in this show. Miller characterizes them as simple anthropomorphized clothing racks that can nonetheless prompt unnerving degrees of identification. Miller\u2019s current photographs, installations, and videos insert these figures into familiar, even normalizing, scenarios that underscore their function as objects of desire onto which we, as both spectators and consumers, project a miasma of fleeting trends and fashions. These projections convey not only the sphere of popular culture but also the expectations of artworks operating within it.\r\n\r\nThe eight large-format photographs, with titles such as The Tip of the Iceberg or Sleeper Cell, feature various mannequin groupings posed against odd, vaguely evocative settings\u2014generic photo backdrops Miller purchased mostly on Amazon. They depict anything from the cockpit of a spaceship to hospital beds to a diagram that references Rosalind Krauss's essay \"Sculpture in the Expanded Field.\"\r\n\r\nThe installation Project for a Revolution in New York is a schematic mannequin rock band seemingly locked in a state of detached contemplation. This deadpan ensemble suggests that what was once a counterculture has devolved into a mode of marketing. Another installation, Epic Theater, restages the kind of photo-shoot Miller used to produce the pictures in this show. Here, the lights and props are real, but the backdrop paper and the stands that support it are merely images printed onto a wallpaper mural.\r\n\r\nIn the video Toll Free, on view in the back gallery, a camera slowly rotates from a central vantage point located in the middle of a busy intersection, picturing the view as if an observer was seated on a slowly rotating office chair. Generic \"on hold\" music plays softly in the background. As floating images of desk phones and mannequin hands come and go, robocalls urge listeners to call back immediately. These sequences alternate with close-ups of the inert face of a male mannequin.\r\n\r\nIn staging the absurd scenes and scenarios pictured in the exhibition, Miller effectively asks, as he himself puts it, \u201cIf mannequins can still command our attention, is it asking too much for them to shoulder some of our impending boredom and frustration in return? Or is it enough simply to fantasize about this prospect?\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Miller was born in 1954 in Cleveland, Ohio, and lives and works in New York and Berlin. Along with Mike Kelley, Jim Shaw and Chris Williams, he was part of an influential group of artists who studied at CalArts in the 1970s. In 2016, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami presented the first major American survey of his work. Miller has had previous solo exhibitions at Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Kunsthalle Z\u00fcrich; Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et contemporain, Geneva; Magasin Centre National d'Art Contemporain, Grenoble, France; and Kunstverein Hamburg. He has participated in group exhibitions at the New Museum, New York; CAPC Mus\u00e9e D'Art Contemporain, Bordeaux; Museo Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid; and MoMA PS1, New York. His work also was included in the 1991 Whitney Biennial and the 2010 Gwangju Biennale. The Schinkel Pavillon in Berlin is planning an overview of his work from the mid-1980s to the present scheduled to open in April 2020. Miller's writing and criticism have appeared in Artforum, e-flux, and Texte zur Kunst and in the compilations The Price Club: Selected Writings, 1977-1996 (JRP Editions and the Consortium, 2000) and The Ruin of Exchange (Geneva and Dijon: JRP-Ringier and les Presses du Reel, 2012).

This is the artist's second solo exhibition at Postmasters and his first at PostmastersROMA. It is also the first time we present one artist in both our locations simultaneously. \r\n\r\nThe subjects in his paintings may change from abstract to figurative and back again, but the foundations of Garcia-Fenech's work remain the same: improvised composition, a tightly restricted palette, close attention to negative space, and a delight in flow. \r\n\r\n\r\nTemet Nosce (Latin for \"Know Thyself\") at PostmastersROMA picks up where Garcia-Fenech's previous exhibition of nervous self-portraits at Postmasters, New York left off. These self-portraits are more agitated, showing the artist tormented by unspecified forces, crushed, exposed, thrown about. And then the figure dissolves. The nudes are replaced by sinuous ghosts. Gone is the architecture of musculature, fat, and bones. Arabesques completely take over, swirling, shaped only by the edges of the tondi. Are they still self-portraits? Are the paintings representational if they depict something that doesn't have substance, that doesn't exist? Are they a wink to the Spiritualist-inspired pioneers of modernist abstraction, to the earnest strivings of Hilma af Klint, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee? \r\n\r\n\r\nIn A Mala Hora (a phrase in Spanish meaning \"at an unfortunate time\") in Postmasters New York, Garcia-Fenech's paintings turn yet more abstract. The monochromatic ghosts become colorful spindles, diamond-shaped compositions whose layers seem to be held together only by centrifugal force, threatening to collapse the moment they stop. Sharing the same vocabulary of forms but expressing very different results, there are the widows: a procession of black curved silhouettes in poses simultaneously suggesting mourning and despair or celebration and sensuality. The new work evinces Garcia-Fenech's recurring m\u00e9lange of influences--classic modernism, medieval illumination, outsider art--plus new interests, including Pre-Columbian pottery, American abstraction of the 1930s, and Islamic calligraphy.", "artforumID": 182348, "showStart": "2020-02-01T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-07T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18508/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Postmasters", "galleryDescription": "Since 1984 Postmasters specializes in contemporary art -generally content oriented, conceptually based, and reflective of our times.", "address": "54 Franklin Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10013", "lng": -74.0026987, "lat": 40.717238113668, "hours": "Tue - Sat 11am to 6pm, Thu 11am to 8pm", "galleryURL": "postmastersart.com", "galleryEmail": "postmasters@thing.net", "phone": "+12127273323", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.876Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.876Z"}, {"id": 283, "title": "The Blues", "description": null, "artforumID": 182358, "showStart": "2020-01-28T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-22T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18518/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Laura Charlton, Blue Improvisation, 2018, Acrylic on paper, 30&#8220; x 22&#8221;", "gallery": "The Painting Center", "galleryDescription": "The Painting Center is a nonprofit exhibition space supporting contemporary painters.

Aptly titled Clay Is Just Thick Paint after a quotation from artist Peter Voulkos, this exhibition argues for the equality of clay and paint as artistic materials. Trained as a painter, Rochlin began working with clay in 2007 and now exclusively works with the medium. This exhibition features ten of her hand-built pots and reliefs, each of which tells a story about love, lust or longing.\r\n\r\nRochlin\u2019s pots and reliefs highlight her interest in storytelling and the human body. The former are metaphors for the body, each having its own lumps and imperfections. Every piece in this exhibition is a memory embodied. Rochlin covers her pots\u2019 surfaces with vignettes whose painterly quality alludes to the way impressions often take precedent over details in our recollections. As viewers experience the pots in the round, they encounter scenes unbound by chronological order, just as personal memories often arise out of sequence. Even Rochlin\u2019s construction methods connect to storytelling; the pinches and pokes she uses to give her pots form mirror the hand gestures storytellers use to punctuate their narratives.\r\n\r\nJennifer Rochlin (born 1968 in Baltimore, MD) is a Los Angeles-based artist working in ceramics and painting. She has had solo exhibitions at Geary Contemporary (New York, NY; 2019), Lefebrvre & Fils (Paris, France; 2018), The Pit (Los Angeles, CA; 2018) and Black Dragon Society (Los Angeles, CA; 2007). Rochlin\u2019s work has been featured in numerous group and two person shows such as Paintings and Pots, The Green Gallery (Milwaukee, WI; 2018); Jennifer Rochlin/Gene Moreno, Institute of Visual Arts, University of Milwaukee (WI; 2007); Home Show, Revisited, Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum (CA; 2011), Open Daybook, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (CA; 2011); MKE-LAX, Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design (WI; 2012); Venice Beach Biennial, in conjunction with Made in LA, Hammer Museum (Los Angeles, CA; 2012) and Sculptures, 356 Mission (Los Angeles, CA; 2013). Rochlin is the recipient of the Individual Artist Grant from the Belle Foundation (2015) and the Durfee Foundation ARC Grant (2007) and has had residencies at Lefebvre & Fils (Versailles, France; 2018) and Civitella Ranieri (Umbria, Italy; 2019).\r\n\r\nAngelik Vizcarrondo-Laboy (born 1992 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a New York-based curator, writer and arts administrator focusing on contemporary art and craft, with an emphasis on ceramics. She serves as Assistant Curator at the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD), New York. Since 2016, she has been part of MAD\u2019s curatorial team, helping to organize over nineteen exhibitions and installations. She also manages MAD\u2019s Burke Prize, a contemporary craft award,and curates its accompanying exhibition. She is a 2020 Curatorial Fellow at the Center for Craft (Asheville, NC), where she is curating Sleight of Hand, a group show of ceramics that demonstrate the power of humor as a tool of resistance, resilience and healing.

Reflecting on the long shadow cast by the tradition of landscape painting, this exhibition explores a complex relationship to the environment as it undergoes grave changes. The ten painters gathered in the exhibition carve out space through their chosen medium \u2014 grasping the complexities between ecological and personal anxiety. Varying from abstraction and representation, reality and illusion, the selection of paintings speaks to the indelible human mark on nature, retranslated in certain cases as psychological states rather than definite sites. By deliberately not upholding the canonical genre, the artists allow their work to diverge from the legacies of exploration, colonialism and the cartesian portrayal of space. Instead, space-making is here reshaped around the understanding of the world as one enmeshed and entangled with this damaged, ever-changing earth and our personal relation to it.    \r\n\r\nThe subdued intensity of Alex Kwartler\u2019s bright orange painting depicts a deliquescing snowflake within a blazing surrounding. Brook Hsu\u2019s use of toxic green alludes to a corrosive yet ethereal universe. The intimate scale of her painting prompts the viewer to come close, establishing tight proximity with her works, allowing them to enter the loose fables she composes. In turn, Fran\u00e7ois Lacasse\u2019s paintings seem to refer to a vast subaquatic landscape overrun by amoebas. There is something similarly oceanic in Melanie Authier\u2019s painting, albeit more diaphanous. Behind the draping shapes and delicate palette of Authier\u2019s painting, there is an impression of movement, fastening the viewer under her breaking wave. Rick Leong\u2019s large painting depicts seaside bank in which sediments and water currents are been stacked into a vertical composition. The miry strata trigger a sense of discomfort as we come to understand this swampy accretion as an index of water level changes that will ultimately yield disaster.            \r\n\r\nIn Michael Assiff\u2019s paintings, nature appears barren; unable to thrive. A floral arrangement seems paralyzed under a heavy coat of paint, as if frozen in a perpetual state of display. In reality, Assiff\u2019s work is defined by a painstaking process of careful preparation, taking hours to assemble a detailed composition and the verisimilitude of flora that is his subject. Wanda Koop\u2019s works are concerned with the intangible forces that have an impact on the environment, such as radio waves, nuclear activity, and pollution. Her work is informed by the constant flow of information that apprises our relationship to the natural world. Multilayered in blooms of color, they reveal a quiet meditation on the malaise of our times brought on by pressing ecology plights.               \r\n\r\nCindy Ji Hye Kim\u2019s phenakistoscope painting, a reference to this early animation device, paradoxically amplifies the fixedness of the subjects caught within it. Perpetually climbing a ladder in this implied animation, these female characters foolhardily aim to reach a higher point, a clearer vantage, of a dense site like the cities we inhabit. The delicate palette and curated pastiche of Sojourner Truth Parson\u2019s canvas suggests a cityscape viewed through literal rose-tinted glasses. This deeply personal exploration of a public space parses through the marriage of iconic vantages and the quiet pleasures of the everyday. Trained in portraiture, Janet Werner\u2019s works are composites of images of (mostly) women culled from fashion magazines. The spaces these subjects inhabit straddle an ideological openness and the trappings of psychological anxiety of the ideal realms that only these sleek images capture.    \r\n\r\nMichael Assiff (b. 1983 in St.Petersburg, FL, lives and works in Queens, NY). His work has been exhibited at Valentin (Paris), at the Rijksakademie (Amsterdam) and Magenta Plains (New York).  \r\n\r\nMelanie Authier (b. 1980 in Montreal, QC, lives and works in Val-des-Monts, QC).

Selected by artist Spencer Sweeney, this is the first New York exhibition of Van Vliet\u2019s paintings in more than a decade.\r\n\r\nA celebrated, prodigious child sculptor who grew up to reinvent himself as the legendary musician Captain Beefheart, Don Van Vliet today holds a place in rock-and-roll history as one of the most exacting and unconventional recording artists of his time. Van Vliet brought the wrenching howl of Delta blues to bear on his own oddball, avant-gardist boogie, recording challenging music that divided listeners and inspired generations. It was later that A.R. Penck identified \u201cthe demonic animality of man\u201d in Van Vliet\u2019s paintings, but he could have just as easily been describing the sound of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band at its peak. No other music of its time sounded like it.\r\n\r\nVan Vliet painted throughout his many years performing, and in the mid-1980s turned away from music to devote his intense creative energy solely to painting. Chosen by artist Spencer Sweeney, the works comprising Parapliers the Willow Dipped explore the range of Van Vliet\u2019s output over three decades and present an artist fully in tune with the legacies of European and American painting. An untitled canvas from 1967, the earliest painting in the exhibition, demonstrates the primal, vital elements of Van Vliet\u2019s creative DNA: a splatter and spill resolves into a haunting, vestigial human form, unsettling in its refusal to claim identity as either abstraction or figuration. This restlessness can be traced throughout the entirety of Van Vliet\u2019s frenetic oeuvre. Drawing on the visceral power of mid-century New York School abstraction as well late twentieth century European painting, Van Vliet embellishes those legacies with a twist of terror and weirdness, his own brand of American surrealism.\r\n\r\nDon Van Vliet was born in Glendale, California, in 1941. Since 1985 Van Vliet\u2019s work has been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Bielefelder Kunstverein, Brighton Museum and Art Gallery, Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York and the Brandt Foundation in Greenwich, Connecticut. Don Van Vliet died at home in northern California in 2010.\r\n\r\nParapliers the Willow Dipped, Paintings 1967-1997 opens 31 January at Michael Werner Gallery in New York and will remain on view through March. A reception will be held on 30 January from 6-8PM featuring a performance by Nona Hendryx. Gallery hours are Monday through Saturday, 10AM-6PM.

I imagine it\u2019s like finding a good guitar hook. Layer hooks.\u201d \r\n \r\nAt the core of Kremer\u2019s practice is a three-part journey: inspiration and conception, exploration via digital experimentation, and execution through manual articulation. First comes an idea for how shapes can exist in unison. How relative geometries can conflict or harmonize with one another. How dimension and weight can override flatness. Then, digital \u201clayers\u201d are created, providing the opportunity for initial compositional layouts to be worked and reworked into varying networks of shapes and structures. Kremer utilizes technology to support an endless process of discovery and refinement. Trial and error with no limits. And at the right moment, as Kremer noted, \u201csometimes things land perfectly.\u201d The prime arrangement of layered colors and forms, with arcing lines meeting hard edges in equilibrium. Art critic Raphael Rubinstein has written: \"Kremer is also keenly aware that today the dominant model is neither Renaissance perspective nor Modernist flatness, but the virtual space of digital screens. Here, too\u2013by sketching his paintings on a computer, then emphatically making them by hand\u2013Kremer deconstructs binary thinking. What makes Kremer\u2019s demolition of binary structures all the more impressive is that he is able to do so with such ebullience, such joy in the sheer facts of color and shape.\" (1) Kremer\u2019s process incorporates mental, digital, and tactile components. The possibility for a composition that ignites within Kremer\u2019s mind at once meets a process of perfected, digital sketching, but ultimately becomes reinterpreted with subtle elements of chance bound to the human-enacted process of painting. Over the course of several years, Kremer has refined the ways in which he combines paint, canvas, and the use of specific brushes to form incredibly dry, but vibrant surfaces. With a sureness of hand, Kremer achieves a balance between the boldness behind his gestural, expressive stroke, and the precision of his meticulous draftsmanship.\r\n \r\nIn considering Layer Hooks as the visual equivalent of guitar hooks in music, where the right chord progressions sometimes mesh, Kremer seeks to achieve a balance both in each individual composition and in his body of work as a whole. Each work in this exhibition explores how resolute geometric forms can at once present as shapes in a vacuum, and, upon closer examination, can also unveil subtle architectural spaces. Shown in this exhibition for the first time is one in a series of \u201cworking sculptures\u201d created by Kremer and his father-in-law Roy Kerstiens. These sculptures are realized from already-existing paintings, or series of paintings, and have the ability to be manipulated in order to be used as reference material for new painting variations. \r\n \r\nAs writer Katja Horvat has stated: \u201cKremer\u2019s ingenious work cleverly blurs the line between abstraction and representation--a result that feels like one big optical puzzle.\u201d (2) What first could appear as an entirely flat space within a Fold painting might transform in a viewer\u2019s mind into a three dimensional space, where a floor meets a wall, and an object\u2019s shadow is cast upon these planes. Art historian and curator Alex Bacon has noted: \u201cAbstracting from familiar forms, even if taking them far beyond immediate recognizability, enables Kremer, as it did those historical artists, to harness the sensations that arise from our day-to-day encounters\u2014whether the impressive profile of a boulder or the sensual curve of a hip\u2014so as to imbue the heraldic forms that appear in their paintings with immediacy and an affective impact.\u201d (3) Kremer also carefully considers how his own work will exist beyond digital sketches, and ultimately outside his studio. The curved form of a Dive painting might seem to extend beyond the limits of its canvas, and even into the path of another line seeming to escape its own boundaries from a neighboring Ascend. Couplets and even groupings of paintings form new conversations and invoke the elements of the space in which they are installed into their overall existence.\r\n \r\nA self-taught artist, Paul Kremer was born in Chicago, IL in 1971, and now lives and works in Houston, TX. For twenty years he owned a graphic design studio, where he worked with such clients as Lou Reed, Tom Waits, PBS, and National Geographic. Kremer was a founding member of the art collective \"I Love You Baby,\" which was active from 1998 to 2008. He co-founded this group with Rodney Chinelliot and Will Bentsen, with regular participation from other Texas-based artists, such as Mark Flood.\r\n \r\nKremer is also known for having invented the now cult-followed Tumblr and Instagram accounts \u201cGreat Art in Ugly Rooms.\u201d Just as its name would indicate, this work chronicles a series of 20th century masterworks that Kremer has seamlessly Photoshopped into shabby interiors, sometimes with outdated decor or dilapidated finishings, rendering iconic examples from art history surely out of place. As Hrag Vartanian relayed in an opinion piece published with Hyperallergic: \u201cIt amazes me that Marcel Duchamp\u2019s \u2018Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\u2019 (1912) looks surprisingly at home in a wood-paneled room, or that the Barnett Newman easily blends into the bargain store surroundings by visually being transformed into a generic super graphic. Some of the art does look out of place, like the work by Jean-Michel Basquiat, which is far too edgy and busy for a typical fast-food chain.\u201d (4) \r\n \r\nKremer has had recent solo exhibitions at Nancy Littlejohn Fine Art, Houston, TX; Berggruen Gallery, San Francisco, CA; Eugene Binder, Marfa, TX; Sorry We\u2019re Closed, Brussels; Pablo Cardoza, Houston; and Makebish, New York. Kremer has also exhibited with Marauni Mercier, Belgium; Library Street Collective, Detroit, MI; and Studio Cromie, Grottaglie, Italy.\r\n \r\nPaul Kremer: Layer Hooks will run at Alexander Berggruen (1018 Madison Avenue, Floor 3) from February 7-March 11, 2020.

The exhibition marks a moment in which the interplay of disciplines in Bokaer\u2019s practice can be perceived and encountered within a gallery setting. Through their confrontation of stereotypes and iconoclasm, the featured works explore the complexities at large in Western representation and identification of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa. The arabesque as a visual motif and building block of western dancing \u2014 along with the orientalism implied \u2014 provides a visual portal into the complexities of this genre, across disciplines. The exhibition features an array of works developed by Bokaer during his awarded residency at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation in Captiva, Florida (2019). Works include ten lithographs and seriographs with multiple color separations and choreographed overlays of drawing, created with master printer Patrick Miko / Long Road Projects. The exhibition also presents two video works, and a brute color image-transfer installation onto wood. On March 6th, during New York\u2019s Armory Week, Bokaer debuts The Genie, a performance that deconstructs the representation of men within the Middle East and North Africa through the emblematic image of a genie. Bokaer\u2019s extensive travels to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Jerusalem, Tunisia, and Pakistan form the basis of the imagery exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe Arabesque is a formal term, visual motif, and technical movement with a long and complex history. Its linguistic associations and physical manifestations have evolved since its earliest appearance within the work of craftsmen of the Hellenistic period. The arabesque became formalized in its use in Islamic cultures as a decorative style. Today, we associate the arabesque perhaps most closely with the fundamental ballet technique. Early classical ballet iconography was often inspired and adopted from the visual arts \u2014 prior to centuries of evolution in western classical dance. The famed 19th century Italian ballet teacher and writer Carlo Blasis writes that \u201cwe have derived [arabesques] from antique relievos, from a few fragments of Greek paintings, and from the paintings in fresco at the Vatican, executed after the beautiful designs of Raphael\u201d (74-75). The arabesque stems from many sources and produces varied cultural associations. Bokaer infuses his exploration of the arabesque with his own personal history, allowing his Tunisian heritage to open new windows of understanding and identification. Bokaer weaves together and pulls apart the multitude of significations derived from each form of the arabesque. He dissects and expands the history of the arabesque without collapsing it, following the strands into each discipline he works within \u2014 and reconciling unexplored tensions between the graphic and choreo-graphic arts.\r\n\r\nAbout An Arabesque explores associations of other kinds as well, in those pertaining to individuals and particularly men in the Middle East, who are often depicted as ruthless, tough, and belligerent. Bokaer traverses these con-temporary representations in sifting through the underdeveloped significations. Appropriating imagery of crossings of the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, including groups and individuals in refugee camps, he sees a reality of men more to do with sensibility. Sensibility being a major component of Bokaer\u2019s reality \u2014 it provides him with a method and means through which to explore an image, an idea, a movement. The work is unforced, gentle, and intimate yet does not shy from exploring what can be hard or harsh, weaving personal, structural, and geopolitical overlays into a deeply interwoven whole.\r\n\r\nDuring his residency at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Bokaer spent five weeks last spring challenging himself by choosing to work in the massive rotunda where Rauschenberg worked later in life. Bokaer recalls dancing in his twenties on the Foundation\u2019s lawn for Rauschenberg, visiting that fabled workspace as the youngest dancer ever hired by Merce Cunningham \u2014 and the only dancer of Middle Eastern origins in that canon. During that visit, Rauschenberg gifted Bokaer two impactful items: Bokaer\u2019s first artwork (a signed Rauschenberg Monotype), and a personal totem (a Titanium Ring fit for Bokaer\u2019s ring finger). Overwhelmed, Bokaer wore the ring for decades, never removing it during performance. Of the event Bokaer notes, \u201cImagine artists not literally wedding each other, but reaching out to help each other \u2014 across time. That ring never left my body. So I began to read Calvin Tomkins, in order to cope with it.\u201d Since that time, Bokaer has firmly developed his own individual practice and career \u2014 having established three arts facilities through the Jonah Bokaer Arts Foundation, his eponymous dance company, as well as his own visual art practice along with numerous artistic collaborations. It is fitting that as Bokaer melds together the choreographer and visual artist within himself, he returns to where he has come from: engaging with a significant milestone in his career and his own ethnicity and artistic heritage, within one unified body of work. David Velasco describes certain responses of modern dance to key features of modernism as being \u201cnot beyond the pale: they are a rendezvous with and within a canon\u201d (8). In his expansion of definitions within choreography and visual art, in his examination of their presence today and in the past, Bokaer\u2019s work is a rendezvous with a number of personal, cultural, and historical canons.\r\n\r\nBlasis, Carlo.

Since 2002, Bokaer has cultivated a new form of choreography merged with visual art and design. He has created over 63 works in a wide range of mediums, such as film, opera, mobile apps, and installation, in a variety of venues ranging from stages, museums, and galleries to architecturally resonant locales. Bokaer has presented works that operate between choreography, visual art, and moving images at many museums including the Guggenheim Museum, MoMA PS1, New Museum, Cooper Hewitt, Museum of Art & Design, MASS MoCa, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Ludwig Museum of Budapest, MAC Marseille, Miami MoCA, IVAM Valencia, Palazzo Delle Arti Napoli, Kunsthalle St. Gallen, Delaware Art Museum, SCAD Museum of Art, MUDAM Luxembourg, and Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. Bokaer is a recipient of a Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Residency (2019), a UNC DisTIL Mellon Foundation Fellowship (2019-2020), the Mohr Prize at Stanford University (2019), among numerous others. His work resides in many private collections and in the permanent public collections of the Parrish Art Museum and Center for Jewish History, New York. In his dance and choreography practice, Bokaer has worked with Merce Cunningham (2000\u20132007), John Jasperse (2004\u20132005), David Gordon (2005\u20132006), Deborah Hay (2005), Tino Sehgal (2008), and many others. He has also interpreted the choreography of George Balanchine as restaged by Melissa Hayden. Bokaer is also a frequent choreographer for Robert Wilson (2007\u2013Present). Jonah Bokaer Choreography, Bokaer\u2019s multi-ethnic dance company, has authored 63 original works produced in 34 nations, 27 American states, and 292 cities across the globe, and is currently exhibiting and touring worldwide with 8 international dancers. In addition to his artistic practice, Bokaer has established a non-profit practice that has succeeded in delivering 3 permanent arts facilities for younger artists: The Jonah Bokaer Arts Foundation is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization which through the support of its Board, generous donors, foundation grants, and government support, the organization has triumphed in crafting and fulfilling a dual mission: to foster the development, research, and presentation of new performance works across disciplines, while establishing affordable art spaces for artists, notably Chez Bushwick (2002) & CPR (Co-Founded 2008), adjacent affordable studios in Brooklyn, and Space 428 Hudson (2016): incuba-tor of The Hudson Eye.

In 2018 there\u00a0were 1,637,000 freight cars in operation across North America, each distinctive in their construction,\u00a0markings and utility. Time\u00a0and human contact add to each train car\u2019s individuality:\u00a0all carrying a vast, and sometimes surprising array of goods and resources. This\u00a0series of photographs captures the still active rail lines that carry freight\u00a0to destinations across the country.\u00a0\u00a0Mallon\u2019s industrial landscape photographs isolate freight cars within this iconic\u00a0transportation system, which has played a\u00a0critical role in supply\u00a0infrastructure across the continent for hundreds of years. \u00a0&#8232;&#8232;Like the electrical synapses firing\u00a0in the human brain, unseen and invisible, but essential to our ability to\u00a0function, 140,000 miles of train tracks traverse\u00a0America. Countless loads\u00a0of steel, grain, coal and everything in between travel supported by this ancient network of distribution.\u00a0\u00a0Mallon has been\u00a0finding locations from New York\u00a0to California, patiently waiting\u00a0for the combination of light, subject and environment\u00a0to capture unique\u00a0images where they intersect.  He has chosen the \u201cdecisive moment\u201d to capture these speeding boxcars photographically. There is an intersection of\u00a0mechanical and natural worlds, singular encounters where the trains activate the landscape, which for Mallon are fleeting and hard to\u00a0predict. \u00a0Patience leads to the essential moment\u00a0when these elements come\u00a0into position: the points in time where the colors and shapes of each railcar, all of the nuances of the light\u00a0reflecting from the loads of steel, wood, and everything else are composed and\u00a0captured. \r\n\r\nStephen Mallon is well know for his series \u201cNext Stop Atlantic,\u201d featuring decommissioned NYC Subway cars as they are retired in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean as artificial reefs, as well as his series \u201cBrace for Impact\u201d, which chronicles the reclamation of the plane which was successfully landed in the waters of the Hudson river by Captain \u201cSully\u201d Sullenburger.\r\n\r\nMallon\u2019s work has been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally, and his work has been written about in many publications, including National Geographic, The New Yorker, New York Times, Vanity Fair, Wired, Stern, PetaPixel, Viral Forest, BuzzFeed, New York Magazine, The Huffington Post, and featured on CNN, CBS, MSNBC and NPR.", "artforumID": 182507, "showStart": "2020-02-13T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-15T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18667/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Stephen Mallon, &#8220;Passing Freight&#8221;", "gallery": "Front Room Gallery", "galleryDescription": "Contemporary art gallery in Lower East Side. est. 1999, in  Brooklyn, New York; concentration on photography, painting and installation.", "address": "48 Hester Street", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10002", "lng": -73.9904595, "lat": 40.715619213667, "hours": "Wed - Sun 1pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "www.frontroomles.com", "galleryEmail": "info@frontroom.org", "phone": "+17187822556", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.894Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.894Z"}, {"id": 301, "title": "Nora Chavooshian: Women's Wrok- Sculpture & Trama Textiles, Mayan Women Weavers Collaboration", "description": "Denise Bibro Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, NYC, is pleased to announce Nora Chavooshian\u2019s fourth major exhibition with the gallery.\r\n\r\nChavooshian continues her life\u2019s journey exploring her identity and universal truths through the lens of her Armenian heritage. What differentiates this exhibition from others is her focus on the work of women and their tenacious efforts to keep their cultural identity regardless of the atrocities that they have experienced. It is a repetitive damning part of history that abominations like the genocide that occurred in 1915 against the Armenian people are present today. Unfortunately, we have witnessed this in Burma, Yugoslavia, Syria, Africa, and Guatemala, to name only a few.\r\n\r\nChavooshian\u2019s sculpture reflects her keen interests and empathetic concern for human global struggles. The preservation of the human spirit is paramount to her. Her sculptures are visual metaphors and symbols of her own personal identity. Her exploration parallels that of others and confirms that the needs and desires of human beings are universal; even if they are on different platforms. She is a woman at work, and like others, women continue to do work that is life affirming.\r\n\r\nHer piece, Tidal, is a bold structured composition comprised of cast forton and beads. Tidal has a strong skeletal structured outline. The crevices and textures within its girth have nestled beads, evoking a story of women at work. This piece elicits a feeling of doing and making. Enveloping beads appear to suggest the continuum of greatness through dexterity. In Lace, she incorporates the beautiful and very personal work of her Grandmother, a survivor of the Armenian Genocide.\r\n\r\nThe piece literally flows from its structure like a river. By replicating her Grandmother\u2019s lace work and repurposing it you can feel the weight of emotion both then and now as if you could see her Grandmother\u2019s fingers working as she perseveres in her journey of survival. Grandmother and granddaughter are of one mind. The downward pouring emotions evoke the feeling of release.\r\n\r\nIt is often the women from traumatized societies who are the ones tasked with resurrecting their culture, igniting the will to survive and inspiring the determination to move forward in a progressive and life-affirming direction.\r\n\r\nChavooshian takes a very courageous step to include works, not only of her own, but in collaboration with others. She witnessed how the Guatemalan Mayan women, who have survived the Genocide of the 1970s-1980s worked and weaved, asserting their culture and identity; evoking the same sensibilities as the works of her female Armenian family. Subsequently she created the collaborative piece, Trama, by incorporating Mayan Women\u2019s weaving into a single larger work. Although each framed part reflects one artist\u2019s aesthetic, the combination of them all evoke a sense of unified solidarity. Nora\u2019s sculptured grid frames and complements each artist\u2019s contribution which creates the flux and glue that gives the work full meaning. Together they have created a work that reveals their compelling stories and history.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative work is available to collectors with proceeds going to the 100% Women\u2019s Worker Owned Weaving Cooperative, Trama Textiles that exists in Guatemala.\r\n\r\nFinally, this exhibition, not only illustrates the breadth of Chavooshian\u2019s journeys and heightened awareness, but it is a prevailing reminder of women\u2019s universal role of moving society in a life affirming direction.\r\n\r\nChavooshian\u2019s sculpture commands the viewers to reckon and take note.\r\n\r\nNora Chavooshian has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and is in private and public collections in both the U.S. and Europe. Her exhibitions include Max Hutchinson Gallery, NY; Denise Bibro Fine Art, NY; The Los Angeles Women\u2019s Building; Trenton City Museum, NJ; Monmouth Museum, NJ; and Salem State College, MA. She has received numerous awards, and commissions including a California Arts Council Grant to curate a show of San Francisco women\u2019s artwork at the Los Angeles Women\u2019s Building.\r\n\r\nAmong various public parks and buildings, Chavooshian\u2019s public artwork includes an exterior sculpture commissioned for the University of Minnesota\u2019s state of the art Tashjian Bee and Pollinator Discovery Center in which she collaborated with a beekeeper to incorporate bees and their honeycomb formed into her bronze sculpture. She was also commissioned for a major permanent bronze sculpture in the Montclair New Jersey\u2019s children park.\r\n\r\nWidening her discipline and arena as a sculptor, she has designed award-winning sculptural stage sets, as well as film production design.

The exhibition will survey over five decades of the artist\u2019s work, spanning the late 1960s through the 2000s. This will be O\u2019Neal\u2019s first solo exhibition in New York in over 25 years. On view from February 6 through March 14, 2020, the exhibition will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSince the late 1960s, Mary Lovelace O\u2019Neal has been known for her singular paintings that pair bold, monumental scale with layers of unexpected materials to explore both deeply personal narratives and mythologies as well as broader themes of racism and social justice and contemporary critical debates. With roots in both Minimalist and Expressionist painting, her imagery has, over years and series, fluctuated between pure abstraction, narrative figuration, and the evocative spaces in between.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBorn in 1942 in Jackson, Mississippi, O\u2019Neal grew up in Jackson, Mississippi; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Gary, Indiana; and Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of a university music professor who fostered her interest in artmaking from an early age. She went on to earn her BFA from Howard University in 1964. While an undergraduate, she became an active participant in the Civil Rights movement, joining in marches, protests, and voting drives in Washington, DC and across the country with then-boyfriend Stokely Carmichael. Recognized by Howard faculty as a special talent, she was awarded a scholarship to spend the summer of 1963 studying at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. There, she investigated an abstract expressionist style, paying close attention to the work of Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and, especially, Franz Kline.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 1968, O\u2019Neal moved to New York due to her first husband, John O\u2019Neal\u2019s, status as a conscientious objector and his fundraising efforts for the Free Southern Theater. She studied at Columbia University, earning her MFA in 1969, the only African American student in her class. During this period, she developed her breakthrough body of work, the Lampblack series. In these paintings, O\u2019Neal applied layers of loose, powdered black pigment to large, unstretched and stretched canvases using a chalkboard eraser or her hands, then punctuated her rich, velvety surfaces with spare white or colored thin lines that function similarly to Barnett Newman\u2019s \u201czips.\u201d By encasing the unprimed canvas fibers in pure pigment, she abandoned her expressionist style to engage with contemporary dialogues around \u201cflatness\u201d\u2014as exemplified by the soak-staining methods of the Color Field painters\u2014 while her monochrome surfaces referenced Minimalist painting (Donald Judd was among her favorite lecturers at Columbia). However, her pursuit of abstraction using pure black pigment was also a wry response to her friends within the Black Arts Movement, who had criticized the lack of narrative social critique in her work. As she pointed out to them at the time, her lampblack paintings were \u201cas black as they could be\u201d; in addition to the literal blackness of their materials, their conceptualism linked them to abstract traditions in African art, in which intangible spirits or ideas are considered essential elements of sculptural form. The current exhibition will include a group of works from this seminal series, an example of which was recently unveiled in the permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing her graduation from Columbia, O\u2019Neal moved to the West Coast, where she established a studio in Oakland and took a teaching position at the San Francisco Art Institute. Throughout the \u201970s, she would go on to teach part-time at the Art Institute as well as at California College of Arts and Crafts, Humboldt State University, Laney College, and University of California, Berkeley, where she became a professor in 1979.  In 1985, she was the first African American awarded tenure in Berkeley's Department of Art Practice and ultimately became Chair of the department. She has been professor emerita since 2006. Over her decades as an educator, O\u2019Neal has continued to make work and has exhibited across the country and internationally.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the \u201970s, O\u2019Neal reintegrated vibrant color and expressionist gesture into her lampblack canvases; she has said it was as though the black paintings had been \u201cunzipped\u201d to reveal the color underneath. She expanded her tableaux on a monumental scale, layering 7 x 12-foot canvases with charcoal, pastel, dye, and glitter, in addition to paint. These subsequent series take inspiration from music and literature as well as her own lived experiences, from vivid childhood memories to the varied color and light experienced on her extensive international travels, particularly those to North and West Africa and the Atacama and Sahara deserts. For example, in her Whales Fucking series from the \u201970s and \u201980s, the abstracted forms of magisterial sea creatures arch and glide across lush backdrops of layered brushwork. O\u2019Neal has explained \u201cWhales are associated with freedom and a tremendous intelligence we don\u2019t understand\u201d; the works were inspired by her observations of whales swimming off the California coast, as well as by D.H. Lawrence\u2019s poem, \u201cWhales Weep Not!\u201d. In her Panther series of the \u201980s and \u201990s, abstracted black panther forms prowl and pounce through the halls of Moorish palaces. The paintings\u2019 space and structure were informed by the vernacular architecture O\u2019Neal encountered in Morocco, where she completed an artist\u2019s residency in 1984. Their imagery was also inspired by the Gian Carlo Menotti opera Amahl and the Night Visitors, in which she performed as a child when her father staged a production at his university. The black panthers themselves draw associations to the artist\u2019s long history of activism. In more recent bodies of work from the 2000s, O\u2019Neal has continued to mine not only the architecture but also the fabrics, costumes, food, pottery, and fauna of the places she has lived and worked, including Egypt, Senegal, Nigeria, Brazil, and Chile. A fantastical cast of imaginary characters people many of these works, their stories unfolding enigmatically from canvas to canvas.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChasing Down the Image will be O\u2019Neal\u2019s first exhibition in New York since her solo show at the French Embassy here in 1993. She has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1979), the Cit\u00e9 International des Arts, Paris (1994) and the Mississippi Museum of Art, Jackson (2002). An exhibition of her Whales Fucking series, Mary Lovelace O\u2019Neal: Whales, a Romance\u2026, will be on view at the Museum of the African Diaspora, San Francisco, from March 25 through August 23, 2020. O\u2019Neal\u2019s work is in the permanent collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian Institutions, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the National Museum of Fine Arts, Santiago, Chile, among other institutions. She has been married to the Chilean painter, Patricio Moreno Toro, for the past 38 years.

Works by Francois Quesnel, Luigi Sabatelli, Paul Borel, Jacques-Louis David, Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard, and Jackson Pollock reveal the dynamic range of drawing as the preeminent expressive discipline to study human thought.\r\n\r\nThe earliest work is a delicate 17th century watercolor and graphite portrait of a noblewoman by Francois Quesnel, (Edinburgh 1542-1619, Paris). Her aristocratic family name La Dame de Baillet identifies her from the Court of Burgundy. Drawn from the side almost in profile, with a light touch without modeling, the genteel lady is a study in composure. \r\n\r\nAnother very different portrait drawing by Paul Borel (French, 1828-1913) presents a fashionable 19th century man seated in an Empire chair and twisting toward the viewer and artist. In a diminutive portrait composition, the influence of Jean Dominique Ingres is realized in the delicate features of the porcelain complexion, the details of the jewelry and waistcoat of the alert gentleman. \r\n\r\nThe classical composition by Jean Jacques-Louis David (French, 1748-1825) is a loosely drawn elegant tableau of Paris playing his lyre for Helen as she swoons resting her arm on his shoulder. The drawing was made around 1785 in one of his albums filled with trace drawings he made from original Greek vase paintings during his years in Rome. The corresponding painting Paris et Helene was commissioned by the Duc D\u2019Artois and is now in the Louvre. \r\n\r\nThe Pierre Bonnard (French, 1867-1947) drawing Nu devant le miroir is of his wife, Marthe, standing in front of a full-length mirror in a compressed composition showing her back side in contraposto, closest to the picture plane, as she admires herself in her reflection. This modern drawing on serrated notebook paper packs the space with all the information needed to make a dazzling painting which he did the same year, Femme nue se regardant dans une glace, 1924. \r\n\r\nLuigi Sabatelli (Italian,1772-1850), left, was a pre-romantic Italian artist known for his frescoes of Homeric epics and heroic events from Florentine history. In this dynamic double-sided preparatory drawing for a fresco from the 1830\u2019s, Sabatelli reimagines the 14th century demonstration against ruthless government led by disenfranchised Florentine wood carders and artisans. The fury and passion of his retelling in swift pen and ink bring the revolutionary hero Michele di Lando, to life.\r\n\r\nThe soft contour drawing of a life size baby by Maurice Denis (French 1870-1943) was made in 1896, the year his first daughter N\u00f6elle was born. Denis drew constantly from his family placing them in many Nabis style paintings of his six children with their mother in various lush gardens and beaches. One of the first artists to use photography of his family as a basis for paintings, Denis cropped compositions with a newfound freedom. \r\n\r\nThe double-sided drawing made in 1939-40 by Jackson Pollock (American, 1912-1956) was one of 83 which he gave to his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Henderson. The drawing process stirred unconscious content which may have served to illuminate Pollock\u2019s thought process in the sessions. Filled with dramatic doodles, bird talons, crosses, circles around heads, and a wiry figure holding up a scrawl of a globe, these private sheets of automatic drawing came to the art market with a controversial sale of the material by the doctor. \r\n\r\nA second show in the back gallery features eight Natural History gouache paintings by Barbara Regina Dietzsch (Nuremburg, 1706-1783), below, Studies of a Lemon by Vicenzo Leonardi (Rome, c. 1590-1646), left, two watercolors -a quince and an apple- by Anthelme-Eugene Grobon (French, 1820 - 1878) and garden plans by Leon Dufourney (French, 1754-1818), Fran\u00e7ois Leonard Seheult (French,1771-1840) and Jean Baptists Plantar (French, 1790-1879). \r\n\r\nBorn on September 22, 1706 in Nuremberg, Germany, Barbara Regina Dietzsch was the eldest in an artistic family in which her father, the landscape painter Johann Israel Dietzsch, taught her to paint with gouache on vellum. Her focus on the beauty of nature was rooted in physico-theology, a Protestant movement which held that the splendor and order of nature proved the existence of a virtuous God and that the contemplation of nature is a way of honoring this belief. Dietzsch reached acclaim during her lifetime.", "artforumID": 182831, "showStart": "2020-01-08T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-02-29T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18991/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Paul Borel (French, 1828-1913), Portrait of a seated man, graphite on paper, 12 x 9 3/4\u201d", "gallery": "Victoria Munroe Fine Art", "galleryDescription": "Victoria Munroe Fine Art presents exhibitions of modern and contemporary artist and historical works on paper.", "address": "67 East 80th Street\nApt 2", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10075", "lng": -73.96046685, "lat": 40.776738063696, "hours": "Tue - Fri 11am to 5pm", "galleryURL": "victoriamunroefineart.com", "galleryEmail": "info@victoriamunroefineart.com", "phone": "9179006661", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.914Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.914Z"}, {"id": 326, "title": "DANIEL BUREN | PIERRE HUYGHE", "description": "NEW YORK\u2014Nahmad Contemporary is pleased to announce Daniel Buren | Pierre Huyghe, an exhibition that foregrounds the conceptual affinities between French artists Daniel Buren (b. 1938) and Pierre Huyghe (b. 1962). Presenting a selection of Buren\u2019s vanguard striped paintings from 1966 in dialogue with one of Huyghe\u2019s dynamic aquarium ecosystems from 2013, the show unites two bodies of works that dismantle the conventional relationship between authorship and presentation. \r\n\r\nThe inception of Daniel Buren\u2019s pivotal, striped motif\u2014which continues to form the foundation of his practice today\u2014occurred in 1965 when he noticed the conventional, 8.7-centimeter-wide striped awning fabric lining the storefronts of a Parisian textile market. He adopted this unassuming, two-toned mass-produced fabric as the basis of his paintings, which he bestowed with matter-of-fact titles that list the medium, such as White acrylic paint on red and white canvas (1966), or describe the compositional form, such as Variable Forms Painting (1966). Although Buren left the majority of the striped support untouched, he deliberately distinguished his work from \u201cready-mades\u201d by adding subtle painterly gestures (condensed to narrow, meandering lines across the support or isolated to its perimeter). \r\n\r\nDefying traditional painted allusions of figuration and depth, these important early works mark the artist\u2019s unparalleled use of stripes as a tool to direct attention from the artwork to its surrounding context. The series was created amid great political unrest and robust societal critique at a time when artists aimed to decry institutional power structures. Accordingly, by reducing the artist\u2019s hand and employing systematic stripes, Buren unveiled the work as a neutral object whose value is assigned by the context in which it is placed. \r\n\r\nPierre Huyghe has examined the contextual implications of art exhibitions since the 1990s. His works often present themselves as situated networks, a continuity between a wide range of intelligent life forms (biological, technological) and matter that learn, modify and evolve. This exhibition centers on Cambrian Explosion (2013) from his aquarium series, which he began in 2010 and comprises live ecosystems that host aquatic plants and organisms. Radically eschewing traditional artistic media and ideas of authorship, these variable environments evolve independently of the artist\u2019s control.\r\n\r\nIn the featured work, a 280-pound boulder is floating in water over crabs and anemones. The title refers to the sudden biological explosion over 500 million years ago that marked the emergence of almost all animal species. By referring to this moment of incredible volatility in the natural world, Cambrian Explosion suggests a sense of emergence and ephemerality, which is perpetuated by the artist\u2019s use of autonomous living species as his medium. As if summoning the philosophies of Buren, who was an early mentor, Huyghe surrenders his work to contingency and different natures of intelligences: liberating artmaking from conventional institutional values.\r\n\r\nPresenting Buren\u2019s self-reflexive linear textiles and Huyghe\u2019s evolving ecosystem, the exhibition provides a platform to extract a common thread between two very distinct artistic approaches. Whether renouncing painting for machine-made fabric or relinquishing sculpture to the impulses of nature, both artists create distance between themselves and their works, acting as catalysts rather than makers. The resulting works offer brilliant interrogations on the complex relationship between artist, artwork, context and viewer.", "artforumID": 182913, "showStart": "2020-02-11T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-04-04T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id19073/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Pierre Huyghe, Cambrian Explosion, 2013, Image courtesy of the artist; Marian Goodman Gallery, New York; Esther Schipper, Berlin; Hauser &amp; Wirth, London; Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris.

The show will feature a striking departure from past sculptural work with fresh creations that lie between the second and third dimensions, hard and soft, form and their perceived function.\r\n\r\nSouth\u2019s new work delves into the formal in-between in new and sophisticated ways. Her characteristic architectural forms and pseudo-industrial material are condensed. The past emphasis on three-dimensionality, accentuated by boxes and cages, are flattened into grids and swaths of subtle tones. Her signature balsa wood constructs are replaced by tectonic assemblage of softer material -canvas, tarp, packing foam, and thread. Once tight and opaque, the application of color is now painterly and reductive.\r\n\r\nTo see South\u2019s work is to see objects from multiple perspectives and dimensions. [title] featuring a quilting of painted canvas and other fibrous materials is clearly a wall piece, however, the implied flatness is betrayed by foam and tarlatan protrusions, drooping thread, and shadows cast by grills and punctures. The work literally and figuratively hovers between the flat and the spatial.\r\n\r\nThe line too is imbued with dimensionality through the use of thread especially evident in its expressive fringing. As a material it is impossible to separate it from the labor of its use. Drawing and binding becomes the same action.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the compression of form introduces the possibility of depiction. South\u2019s work exhibits a patchwork of ubiquitous architectural and functional forms like the grid, the wheel, and the arch -their combination reminiscent of large control panels or fictional machines.

During the last five years of her life she moved back home with her mother.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo was a resident at the Basaglia Psychiatric Center in Italy, named after Franco Basaglia, who was responsible for radically reforming the psychiatric movement in Italy. She became a member of the Blu Cammello Studio, a workshop and social cooperative that provides opportunities for individuals monitored by the Department of Mental Health to participate in activities dedicated to the development of their creative potential. In recent years, under the supervision of Riccardo Bargellini, a visual artist and designer, the work of several artists from the atelier have been recognized on a global level.\r\n\r\nDespite dealing with challenging symptoms and being one of the most remote patients at Blu Cammello, Michelangelo began to obsessively create, often drawing with both hands simultaneously to complete her work. With uninhibited, intuitive confidence, she produced a unique and cohesive body of work that offers viewers a veiled glimpse into her private inner landscape. Fairies, caves, animals, and abstract linear exploration take shape amid an energy at times seemingly frantic, at others, serene.\r\n\r\nLater in life, she quietly shed her birth name of Alessandra Brigiotti and began signing her works as \u201cAlessandra Michelangelo,\u201d in effect declaring herself an artist of importance. Comparisons to artists such as Peter Saul, Phillip Guston and Giorgio de Chirico (none of whom she was familiar with) are easy to make; however, Michelangelo\u2019s drawings are a singular example of European art brut and very much her own.\r\n\r\nShelter was established in 2016 and focuses on the promotion and exhibition of artists who have been left out of the art historical mainstream. Shelter represents the artists of LAND Studio and Gallery, a program for adult artists with developmental disabilities located in Brooklyn. In 2019, Shelter opened a new space at 179 East Broadway, which is shared with contemporary galleries Sargent\u2019s Daughters and SHRINE.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Blu Cammello and Chris Byrne for their assistance organizing this exhibition.", "artforumID": 183007, "showStart": "2020-01-10T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-08T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id19167/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Shelter", "galleryDescription": "Shelter Gallery presents emerging and mid-career artists in an intimate setting.", "address": "179 East Broadway", "city": "New York", "zip": "NY 10002", "lng": -73.989307082209, "lat": 40.713908245867, "hours": "Wed - Sun 12pm to 6pm", "galleryURL": "shelternyc.com", "galleryEmail": "info@shelternyc.com", "phone": "6468222999", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.916Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.916Z"}, {"id": 282, "title": "Joseph Jarman\u2019s Black Case with Brent Hayes Edwards and Adam Shatz", "description": "A founding member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Joseph Jarman was responsible for the pioneering theatrical and multimedia elements of the avant-garde jazz group\u2019s shamanistic performances, which often also featured the recitation of Jarman\u2019s poetry.

Indeed, the term \u201cwallpaper\u201d has long served as a put-down when directed at works of art, and is but one front on the long-standing debate between art and design over issues like craft, ornamentation, and high-brow vs. low-brow \u2014 but these tensions now serve as vital points of inspiration and productive argument for many artists working today. In particular, artists engaged in the field of media and digital art grapple with this tension even more deeply, perhaps, as the productions of daily life become ever more reliant upon design and driven by technology. The phenomena of the desktop computer \u2018screensaver\u2019 \u2014 a kind of algorithmic wallpaper for digital screens, a function once purposeful but now obsolete \u2014 is used in this context to embrace the allure of the decorative, the unabashed\u00a0joy\u00a0of the painterly process, and the phantasmagorical and hypnotic sensory atmospheres of the screen-based environments which we now inhabit.\r\n\r\nLike the Action Painters, the artists in this exhibition find unique ways to work within the distinctive, formal and often chance-driven properties of their medium: the video signal, the special effect, the motion graphic, the flow of electronic information.\u00a0Like a screensaver, the works churn away with no beginning or end, resisting cinematic tropes of narrative time and space, of visual relationships to reality. Autonomously generating their own power, they produce their own forms and meanings \u2014 an\u00a0after\u00a0effect\u00a0without a\u00a0before.\u00a0\u00a0But, beyond the mere ornamental surface affects being deployed, the viewer is granted a glimpse into the computational energies that allow us to visualize the rhythms and deep patterns of nature and biology and consciousness; to touch upon the synaesthesic \u2018visual music\u2019 of Kandinsky, the spiritual procession of the \u201cworld of forms\u201d as Mondrian described, or the purely chromatic \u201cformulas for all the whirling forces\u201d that so compelled Paul Klee.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOr perhaps, more humbly, screensavers simply allow us a small glimpse into the slumbering inner life of the inanimate objects and machines which now act as our constant servants and companions and portals to the world-at-large \u2014 hinting at the possibility of artificial intelligence, of the animistic natures and personalities we imagine the appliances and totems in our lives to possess.", "artforumID": 182498, "showStart": "2020-02-14T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-15T04:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18658/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": "Sean Capone, Still from \u2018The Sky Report\u2019, HD digital animation, audio, 2017", "gallery": "5-50 Gallery", "galleryDescription": "5-50 Gallery is an art gallery / curatorial project space set in the former site of a stone carving studio in New York City.", "address": "5-50 51st Avenue", "city": "Long Island City", "zip": "NY 11101", "lng": -73.9549265, "lat": 40.741923913679, "hours": "Wed - Sun 10am to 5pm", "galleryURL": "5-50gallery.com", "galleryEmail": "550gallery@gmail.com", "phone": "718-937-5648", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.894Z", "updatedAt": "2020-02-12T18:58:25.894Z"}, {"id": 298, "title": "Joanne Greenbaum: I\u2019m Doing My Face in Magic Marker", "description": "Rachel Uffner Gallery is pleased to present I\u2019m Doing My Face In Magic Marker, Joanne Greenbaum\u2019s third solo exhibition with the gallery. Spanning the entire first floor, Greenbaum will present a series of new paintings and works in kiln-formed glass.\r\n \r\n&#8232;Greenbaum\u2019s practice stretches across an array of mediums, materials, and surfaces. She begins every piece with the intention that it will lead to something different than the last. Greenbaum sets a new challenge for herself with each work, and if something reaches a point of familiarity, she starts over with a fresh perspective. As a result, she has developed a singular body of work\u2014including painting, drawing, and sculpture\u2014that, while instantly recognizable in gesture and spirit, continues to evolve and remain relatively enigmatic. \r\n \r\nAs complicated and intricate as her compositions are, she still considers herself a minimalist. More and more, the artist looks towards the act of drawing as the basis of her paintings, creating a system that allows her to paint freely with a certain amount of restraint. Throughout this show, underlying geometric structures\u2014resembling architectural details such as staircases or scaffolding\u2014modulate Greenbaum\u2019s compositions and operate as framework or support for the overlying loose and immediate gestural marks. This balance of order and chaos, unique to Greenbaum\u2019s work, seems to mirror the frenetic energy of urbanity. \r\n \r\nGreenbaum\u2019s non-hierarchical approach to making enables her interactions with various mediums to remain intimate and her work to grow organically. Through a recent residency at Bullseye Glass Co., New York, Greenbaum seamlessly integrated kiln-formed glass into her artillery of material. Layers of vibrant glass cut by the artist fuse together in the artist\u2019s signature palatable energy. The artist utilizes a similar language of abstraction found in her sculptures and paintings, one that balances the tumultuous with the systematic.\r\nMuch like the underlying structure of her paintings, the confines inherent to the production of kiln-formed glass\u2014in terms of scale and color\u2014act as a framework to the compositions she creates, maintaining the presence and energy found throughout her oeuvre. Greenbaum\u2019s refreshing use of line, mark, and layer in her paintings and kiln-formed glass produce intricate and unruly networks that lead from one gesture to the next. \r\n \r\nJoanne Greenbaum (b. 1953, New York, NY) earned a BA from Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY. Over the past twenty years, Joanne Greenbaum has exhibited widely at international venues including at the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Overland Park, KS; Kusthalle Du&#776;sseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany; and MoMA PS1, New York, NY; among many others.

Over an extensive, five-decade career, Fleischner has produced a wide-ranging body of work that comprises large-scale sited works, sculpture, photography, and drawing. This will be the first solo exhibition of the artist\u2019s work at the gallery, and will be accompanied by an illustrated catalogue, with an essay by art historian and curator Jennifer Gross, formerly the Founding Director of Hauser & Wirth Institute.\r\n\r\nRichard Fleischner is best known for his integrated, site-specific works in cities, parks, woods, and other natural areas, in both public and private arenas. Previous major commissions include those presented at documenta 6 (1977, Kassel, Germany), the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (1977, Washington, DC), Massachusetts Institute of Art (1980-85, Cambridge, Massachusetts), as well as the Dallas Museum of Art (1981, Dallas, Texas). Fleischner\u2019s practice consistently investigates our perceptual and physical interactions with space \u2013 working at the intersection of art, architecture, and urban design, his works are a result of a process of \u201cplace-making\u201d. His sculptural and architectural interventions contextualize and order space, transforming the visitors\u2019 experience of the site. Fleischner has also extended these spatial and formal concerns into the mediums of sculpture and two-dimensional gouache drawings, which he treats as an essential part of his practice. Witness Mark focuses on sculpture and gouaches that have been recently completed, providing deeper insight into the relationship between these key mediums.\r\n\r\nWorks on view in the first room of the gallery include a series of individual sculptures, including Enclosure (2010), Three Cubes (2014), and Untitled #19 (2014-15). Noting that Fleischner\u2019s practice is very much rooted in \u201cunselfconscious architecture\u201d, curator and writer Julia Brown describes the artist\u2019s works as \u201cclosely tied to things seen in the world\u2026 it is a sense of place in its most primitive and primal form.\u201d Exhibited together, this series of sculptures serve as an index of spatial dynamics. In each work, primary forms, planes, and lines are arranged on a unitary surface. Using this fundamental visual vocabulary, Fleischner demonstrates how spatial relationships are established between forms, resulting in boundaries, volumes, and axes being defined within the ground of each individual work. Each element becomes understood in relation to each other, and to the field upon which they stand, resulting in a larger context that is at once ordered and balanced. Recalling basic architectural structures, these sculptures emphasize a return to vernacular, simple forms that are repeated throughout art and architectural history. Standing as an evocation of space and place, Fleischner\u2019s sculptures nevertheless become self-referential formal investigations, executed for their own sake.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue extends into Fleischner\u2019s gouache works, which the artist produced in tandem with his sculptures for over the past four decades. In one series of untitled gouaches, colored, geometric forms appear etched into the ground of the work, echoing the formal properties of the sculptures that are also on view. These heavily textured, tactile works on paper are made by a repetitive process of building up multiple layers of colored paint, and then scratching, sanding, and scraping them down in turn until the depth of the surface has been achieved. Recalling the material appearance of Fleischner\u2019s sculptures, where bronze, earthen-plaster, and even milk-paint are employed to achieve their distinctive finish, the worked surfaces of these gouaches reveal the hand of the artist, striking a personal and intimate register associated with the process of individual mark-making. As with Fleischner\u2019s sculptures, these works are concerned with achieving a balance.\r\n\r\nThroughout the various aspects of Fleischner\u2019s practice, he has drawn from a language of the commonplace, often taking inspiration from paving stones, sidewalks, and rudimentary buildings. The forms and material textures that are seen within his works are references towards a rich history of the everyday.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout the artist\r\n\r\nThe recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, including the Guggenheim Foundation (2018), the Pollock-Krasner Foundation (2016), the Pell Award for Excellence in the Arts (2000), and three National Endowment for the Arts fellowships (1975, 1980, and 1991), Richard Fleischner is one of the leading artists of his generation.

As you make sounds into the microphone, the colors and sounds in the\r\ninstallation follow and mimic the pitch of your voice. This allows you to choose the colors and sounds in the installation using your voice. There is the option to listen to through headphones. Studies show that vocalizing and humming\r\nphysically clear the head, and in turn, clears mental chatter. This interaction of vocalizing in The Tuning House is\r\nintended to be a private, peaceful, mindful activity. It can be playful and energizing.\r\n\r\nCamilla Padgitt-Coles is a multimedia artist (b. 1985, New York, NY) working in real-time physical atmospheres\r\nwith light, color, and sound. In general, she is interested in highlighting fundamental forces around us and applying\r\nthese through light and sound in her work. Projects and collaborations she has worked on span contexts of performance, standalone installations, and musical releases. In 2019 she completed a master\u2019s degree in interactive music\r\nand art from NYU where The Tuning House was her graduate thesis. Her recent work is examining how and where\r\nart and meditation can be combined to create playful experiences through using sensors, data, and inputs to inspire an unpredictability or personalized interactivity for the viewer. The aim is to create a moment of connection, simple and\r\ngrounding, in the body through the senses.\r\n\r\nESSEX FLOWERS\r\nIn the back space\r\n19 Monroe St\r\nNew York, NY 10002\r\nGallery hours: Saturdays and Sundays from 12-6 PM and by appointment\r\nFor appointments and inquiries please email info@essexflowers.us", "artforumID": 182773, "showStart": "2020-02-07T05:00:00.000Z", "showEnd": "2020-03-08T05:00:00.000Z", "imgUrl": "/uploads/guide.005/id18933/exhibition_landscape.jpg", "imgCaption": null, "gallery": "Essex Flowers", "galleryDescription": "Essex Flowers specializes in contemporary art.

This \"Fight-or-Flight\" response is put into motion by the Sympathetic Nervous System, a normally harmonious network of nerves and hormones that, if thrown off balance, can result in serious complications. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sympathetic Nervous System inside me becomes my most reliable ally. In a fitting contrast, my taunting foe the mosquito will never know this delicate yet essential \"Fight-or-Flight\" system. Presented as a process machine, the various extension cord cut-offs make up a continuous electrical circuit based on the finite nervous system of a mosquito. A cluster of 6-volt batteries powers an electronic preamp that feeds a 15kHz sonic frequency up through the electrical circuit of cut-offs and out to the speakers on the receiving end. From my research, 15kHz is the perfect sonic frequency to repel mosquitoes. This circuit, now a crude musical synthesizer, produces a low rumbling static buzz that bleeds into the gallery space. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy nervous system colliding with yours, colliding with the mosquito's, and propelled by an oscillating sound frequency, creates an endless feedback loop.

Through their analysis, Gumby and Shiferaw bring together artists Dominique Duroseau, Torkwase Dyson, Tsedaye Makonnen and Marvin Toure whose work share a commonality in relation to the color black or to the oppositional disposition of Blackness in multiple western societies. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a catalogue produced by LatchKey Gallery with an essay by Niama Safia Sandy.\r\n\r\nAn iteration of the exhibition will continue to Mehari Sequar Gallery in collaboration with the Smithsonian Museum in June, 2020.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE EXHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe color black has been perceived in many ways throughout different cultures. To some, it\u2019s a void, an abyss, a blackhole in which everything gets lost. It\u2019s fearsome. It is the night. To others, it\u2019s the color of beauty, wisdom, strength, and pain. It attracts heat. It is the color through which the African American culture is conceptualized and simultaneously \u201cOthered.\u201d Fred Moten describes Blackness as a form of radicalism, yet it is muffled as an underwater sound. Perhaps, silencing such loud and radical sound is only logical to those who don\u2019t feel the syncopated rhythm of blackness echoing through the depths of the dark universe. \r\n\r\nSuch vibration hits differently beyond the boundaries of cultures within the United States - it is habitually tied in with the misconception of danger or evil. A curse, even. Normality is a societal construct, where perception is skewed against a tone that shines dark-blue in the moonlight. Blackness only becomes a subject matter when in opposition yet transcends melancholy amidst kindred spirits. There is no gaze that\u2019s not oppositional in Western society, where Blackness becomes the object of spectacle.\u201d - Alteronce Gumby, Marvin Toure, and Tariku Shiferaw.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\r\n\r\nDominique Duroseau is a Newark-based artist born in Chicago, raised in Haiti.\r\nHer interdisciplinary practice explores themes of racism, socio-cultural issues, and existential dehumanization. Her exhibitions, performances, and screenings include SATELLITE ART and PULSE Play in Miami; The Kitchen, The Brooklyn Museum and the New Museum (BWA for BLM), El Museo del Barrio, A.I.R. Gallery, BronxArtSpace, Rush Arts Gallery, and Smack Mellon in New York City; The Newark Museum, Index Arts, Project for Empty Space, and Gallery Aferro in Newark, NJ.\r\n\r\nHer recent exhibitions and talks include: solo exhibition at A.I.R. Gallery in Brooklyn, panelist at Black Portraiture[s] at Harvard and lecturer at Vassar.\r\nShe was a fellow at A.I.R. Gallery in Brooklyn, and received artist residencies from Gallery Aferro, Index Art Center, the Wassaic Project and Shine Portrait Studio; and recently awarded residency at MassMOCA, NARS Foundation and Artists Alliance Inc. Duroseau holds a Bachelor of Architecture and a Master of Arts in Fine Arts \r\n\r\nThough working in multiple forms Torkwasa Dyson describes herself as a painter whose compositions address the continuity of movement, climate change, infrastructure, and architecture. For Dyson these subjects in relationship to each other produce abstractions that explore the history and future of black spatial liberation strategies and environmental racism.\r\n\r\nDyson considers spatial relations an urgent question both historically and in the present day. Through abstract paintings, Dyson grapples with ways space is perceived and negotiated particularly by black and brown bodies. Explorations of how the body unifies, balances, and arranges itself to move through natural and built environments become both expressive and discursive structures within the work.\r\n\r\nTsedaye Makonnen is a multidisciplinary artist who exhibits internationally. Her primary focus is on countries within the Americas and African continent. She explores her hyphenated identity as a daughter of Ethiopian immigrants and a black American woman through her studio and research-based practice. Her approach attempts to convey the African Diaspora's response to forced migration and the effort to recreate the Self within new territories. \r\n\r\nShe is currently one of the 2019 Smithsonian Artist Research Fellows, recipient of the DC Oral History Collaborative grant and DC Public Library\u2019s Maker-in-Residence 2018-2019. She just completed the month-long Savage-Lewis Artist Residency at Martha\u2019s Vineyard this Summer with Ayana Evans. They exhibited a multimedia installation of their work, performed and gave an artist talk during Art on the Vine in August 2019. Further, she has performed at the Venice Biennale, Art Basel Miami, Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, El Museo del Barrio, Pratt Film Institute, Queens Museum, Festival International d\u2019Art Performance in Martinique, Chale Wote Street Art Festival in Ghana, Fendika Cultural Center in Ethiopia and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlteronce Gumby is an artist living and working in New York. His artistic practice ranges from painting and ceramics to installation and performance. Gumby\u2019s work has been exhibited at galleries such as Gladstone Gallery, American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center and Camden Arts Centre. In his recent exhibition Catching the Holy Ghost at Parrasch Heijnen Gallery in Los Angeles, CA, Gumby explored color as it refers to transcendence from the physical, to the idea of the spiritual. Painting becomes the artists\u2019 undeniable language of awareness, as an act of transcendence, offering a form of liberation and tranquility through color. \r\n\r\nGumby graduated from the Yale School of Art with an MFA in Painting and Printmaking in 2016. He has won notable awards such as the Austrian American Foundation/ Seebacher Prize for Fine Arts and the Robert Reed Memorial Scholarship. Gumby has also participated in numerous international artist residencies such as the Rauschenberg Residency (2019), London Summer Intensive (2016), Summer Academy in Salzburg, Austria (2015), 6Base (2016), and as the 2016 recipient of the Harriet Hale Woolley Scholarship at the Fondation des \u00c9tas-Unis in Paris. His work was featured in publications such as New American Painting #123 MFA Annual 2016 and BOMB Magazine. Gumby has also curated exhibitions such as Sunrise/ Sunset at Infinity Room Gallery and To Dream Avante-Garde at Hammond Harkins Galleries.\r\n\r\nMarvin Tour\u00e9 is an Ivorian-American artist who uses objects of innocence (artifacts and stories from his childhood and adolescence) as a vehicle to interrogate themes of race and mental health. In 2014 Marvin received a B.A. in New Media Arts with a minor in Architecture from Southern Polytechnic State University (now Kennesaw State University) in Marietta, Georgia. In 2016 he received an M.F.A. in Fine Arts from The School of Visual Arts and soon after completed a residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (2016). Tour\u00e9\u2019s work has been included in exhibitions at Jan Brandt Gallery (2015) in Bloomington, Illinois, The Hole (2016) in New York City, the PRIZM art fair (2016) in Miami, Florida, Project for Empty Space at Gateway Project Spaces in Newark, New Jersey (2016), Smack Mellon (2017) in Brooklyn, New York, the University of Connecticut-Stamford (2018) in Stamford, Connecticut, and the Franconia Sculpture Park (2018) in Shafer, Minnesota. In 2018 Marvin\u2019s first solo exhibition was shown at the AC Institute in New York City, and shortly after he was named as one of the five 2018 FSP/Jerome Foundation Fellows.\r\n\r\nTariku Shiferaw is a New-York-based artist who explores \u201cmark-making\u201d through painting and installation-art in order to address the physical and metaphysical spaces of painting and societal structures. His current exhibitions include Men of Change, a nation-wide traveling exhibition with the Smithsonian Institution; and Unbound, a group exhibition at the Zuckerman Museum of Art. Other exhibitions include the 2017 Whitney Biennial, as part of Occupy Museum\u2019s Debtfair project; A Poet*hical Wager, at the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland; What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It?, at the Drawing Center in New York; Erase Me, at Addis Fine Art, London; and This Ain\u2019t Safe, at Cathouse Proper in Brooklyn.

Jessica Kravitz of Exalted Alchemy created an aromatic experience exclusively for the exhibition. The installation was designed by sculpture Amy Pilkington. The opening reception will be held on Wednesday, January 29, 2019 from 6pm to 8pm.  This is Tina West\u2019s seventh solo exhibition at the Robin Rice Gallery and Tucker Robbins\u2019 first collaboration with Robin Rice.\r\n \r\nInspired of a serendipitous meeting between Robin Rice and Tucker Robbins on a rainy day in New York City, this latest collaboration welcomes an exciting new era at The Robin Rice Gallery. Breaking from the gallery\u2019s traditional style of display, West\u2019s photography will be creatively integrated with Robbins\u2019 artisan furniture. Designed and built on the edge of the forest by indigenous people using centuries-old techniques, these products are born out of  Tucker Robbins\u2019 travels to remote locations. Whether woven textile, clay pottery or wood sculpture, these sustainably made products are materials that have been salvaged and refashioned into works of exquisite craftsmanship that are truly one of a kind.\r\n \r\nFound objects are essential in the installation. Boosting from an impressive visual flow, the installation discovers intersections between the works that can be seen to echo throughout the space. As West\u2019s \u201cPassion Lies at the Edge of Uncertainty\u201d presents an image composed of dark negative space leading down to a snake skin on the surface below, Robbins\u2019 \u201cSnaka Waka Table\u201d is an Acadian side-table found nearby that was named by the Bamun carvers of Cameroon who likened its circular design to snake walking. Together, West and Robbins make for an installation that invites audiences to sit down and connect to the fine art objects in a manner different from what they are regularly accustomed to at the Robin Rice Gallery.\r\n \r\nIn speaking of her influences, West cites Josef Sudek as an early inspiration on her work for how he made evocative black and white photographs out of everyday happenings. Sudek himself once remarked, \u201cI like to tell stories about the life of inanimate objects, to relate something mysterious.\u201d This statement resonates well within West\u2019s own work as she demonstrates a similar gift for finding the beauty in the banality of things overlooked. Her work also shares a kindred spirit with the eccentric assemblages of disparate images made by Joseph Cornell and the experimental platinum prints of Jan Groover. \r\n \r\nFor the past 35 years, Tucker Robbins has been bringing the spirit and craft from traditional artisans to contemporary life by creating sustainable furniture that is both modern and timeless. He has traveled around the world and created workshops in countries like Guatemala, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Cameroon. His latest project will focus on aiding communities in Puerto Rico by collaborating with Caribbean Exotic Hardwoods to help preserve fallen tropical woods and generate job creation to boost the local economy in regions most impacted by recent natural disasters.\r\n \r\nOriginally from Kansas City, Tina West discovered photography while studying sculpture and consequently developed decades of work benefiting from a significant conceptual depth that she explores in her imagery.

The tag and text slogans became known quickly on the streets and in the local newspaper media because of their wit and sardonic humor. Since Basquiat\u2019s rise to fame, the SAMO\u00a9\u2026 legend has become a globally recognized graffito and has been celebrated as cutting social commentary throughout contemporary art history\r\n\r\nAl D\u00edaz\u2019s career spans five decades. Born and raised Puerto Rican in New York City, he was known by age 15 as a prolific and influential, first-generation subway graffiti artist. During the early 70s, his popular and recognized name was \u201cBOMB-1.\u201d After high school and the SAMO\u00a9\u2026 period, D\u00edaz began to practice musical percussion and created recordings, including a performance on Basquiat\u2019s collectible 1983 early hip-hop album, Beat Bop which also featured Rammellzee and K-Rob. After being \u201con the scene\u201d during the 80s Avant-garde art boom, for many years D\u00edaz honed his craft as a foreman/lead carpenter in the New York building industry.\r\n\r\nCurrently, D\u00edaz works with WET PAINT and other signage used throughout the NYC MTA subway system. After cutting out individual letters to create clever-sounding, surreal and poignant anagrams, he hangs the finished messages in City subway stations. In 2016, he resurrected the SAMO\u00a9\u2026 writings and contemporary fans appreciate his frequent use of Instagram (albert_diaz1), where the satirical images are shared widely. Recently, D\u00edaz released to the public his private collection of photographs of Basquiat as a teenager, with several more currently unrevealed.\r\n\r\nD\u00edaz resides in Brooklyn. His work has been shown and privately collected internationally, including in Beyond the Streets (Los Angeles, 2018), Zeitgeist: The Teenage Art Scene of Basquiat (Howl Arts, Inc., New York City, 2018) the World Trade Center (69th Floor Art4WTC, 2017), Urban Arts Fair (Manhattan, 2017) WestchesterArts (From the Streets White Plains, 2017), Art Miami, Scope, The Bishop Gallery (Brooklyn, 2017) and the 21st Precinct Street Exhibit (NYC, 2014). D\u00edaz is featured in film productions (Boom For Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat, BBC\u2019s American Masters\u2014Basquiat: Rage to Riches, Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child), and magazine and book publications, such as Jon Narr and Normal Mailer\u2019s The Faith of Graffiti, 2Create: Art of Collaboration by Yoav Litvin, Street Messages by Nicholas Ganz and most recently, Aljazeera America, art.net, GQ Korea and Vogue UK among many others. D\u00edaz has been a highlighted speaker and artist for a variety of panel discussions, including at the Brooklyn Museum, The New School, Christie\u2019s Education, The Museum of the City of New York, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library, the London Barbican, Art Basel (Switzerland) and NOLA Arts Festival. A notebook that he made with Jean-Michel Basquiat and friends during his teens is currently held in the private collection of the Yale University Beinecke Library. In 2018, D\u00edaz authored SAMO\u00a9\u2026 SINCE 1978, a book meant to clarify, elaborate and illustrate the history and meaning behind the historical SAMO\u00a9\u2026 writings.\r\n\r\n* Carlo McCormick is a pop culture critic, curator and Senior Editor of Paper magazine.

Meiselas photographed life under the Somoza regime during its decline, capturing the devastating personal and collective toll of the insurrection on Nicaraguans.

By including works produced in the last century, the aim is to emphasize the continuity of this condition, creative exchanges, and circulation of ideas beyond borders. The transnational character of these works gives them a certain significance that cannot be understood in terms of any singular national context. They call attention \u201cto the political, economic, and cultural relations that do not take political borders as their ultimate horizon, as well as to their criticism of the normative and exclusionary functions of nationalism\u201d.[1] Within the histories of modern art of both countries, these sets of dialogues and relations began after the Mexican Revolution of 1910; that is from the 1920s. By the end of the 1930s, numerous American artists had traveled to Mexico to attest to the \u201cRenaissance\u201d of its arts, and some of them produced works there. Simultaneously, Mexican artists, particularly male muralists, received commissions for monumental works in the US as well as exhibitions in galleries and museums.\r\n\r\nFrom a historical perspective, Diego Rivera, Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco or David Alfaro Siqueiros might be the names that come to mind when thinking about these kinds of transnational dialogues, but the examples were numerous and involved artists from both nations. In the case of American artists, Grace and Marion Greenwood, Philip Guston, Reuben Kadish, and Isamu Noguchi made murals in Mexico whilst Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez and Jean Charlot made works in the US. Others like Rufino Tamayo and Mar\u00eda Izquierdo resided and worked in New York. The case of Charlot is exemplary in the way in which he embodies an acute transnational, even global, consciousness. Born in France, he moved to Mexico in 1921 where he participated in the formulation of the muralist avant-garde. He was also a promoter of it through books and essays published in the US and elsewhere. He also continued a realist and muralist practice in the US after he established himself in New York in 1928.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the Second World War, and within the domestic and international contexts proper of the Cold War, several American artists settled in Mexico and continued to produce art that pursued certain social ideals and that was committed to realism. Elizabeth Catlett is a paramount example of this. In Mexico, she learned traditional and new artistic techniques, such as wood carving and linoleum printing, and created powerful political works regarding issues of discrimination and social segregation in the US. Within the same context of the Cold War, Canadian-Mexican artist Arnold Belkin was able to produce a realist mural in New York in 1972, bringing the postwar legacy of Muralism, and global realism, to the US. To execute his mural Against Domestic Colonialism, he worked and collected information from the residents of Hell\u00b4s Kitchen. For a committed postwar realist artist, such as Belkin, it was a triumph to create a community-based mural of this kind in the country that had been promoting abstraction as an \u201cideological weapon\u201d during the Cold War.\r\n\r\nSeveral scholars have remarked how New York, during the second half of the twentieth century, became a global epicenter of the arts; a condition that drove numerous artists from around the world to establish in the city. This phenomenon gradually paved the way for the articulation of a harmonious fin-de-si\u00e8cle multiculturalism in discourses around art. Julio Gal\u00e1n was a young artist when he moved to New York in the mid-1980s. Born and raised in the conservative north of Mexico, New York offered him not only a vibrant art scene but also an established and openly gay community and culture. His work documented the anxiety and crisis brought by the AIDS pandemic that erupted around those years, through a style of figuration that placed him in line with late pop aesthetics and the neo-expressionism of Julian Schnabel or Francesco Clemente.\r\n\r\nContemporary artists from Mexico and the US continue to engage in this kind of geographical and cultural exchange. Livia Corona, for example, has developed works that revise the history of this sort of transnational connections. In Rx (Red and Yellow Kills a Fellow) (2015) she abbreviates the history of the silver industry in Taxco, Mexico, in connection with the development of its modern designs, a process in which some American designers and the market of tourism played a crucial role. Yeni Mao in his work fig 20.05 cabal (leo) (2019) alludes to the patio in traditional and modern architecture in Mexico, in particular as a situation of display for plants, ceramics and other forms of decorative arts. For this sculpture, which takes into consideration the solution of the base, Mao produced a piece of ceramic altering an existing industrial model, transforming a regular commodity into an intriguing and suggestive form. Mario Navarro\u00b4s Vision in Motion (2019) combines modern formal principles with traditional fiber works and hand-made solutions, in this case, the weaving of rattan often used in chairs and other kinds of seats. Beyond his artistic production, Navarro has promoted, like Charlot and other artists before him, the sort of transnational dialogues between artists and geographical and cultural contexts that are the focus of this show.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Daniel Garza Usabiaga\r\n\r\n[1] Rebecca M.

The seven artists each create their own unique and complex tapestry of symbols, historical references, and hidden narratives. For insight into each artist\u2019s intentions and process, we asked the artists included in Making the Cut to describe how their choice, and use, of the material, relates to the physical body and the content of their work.\r\n\r\nAruni Dharmakirthi\r\n\u201cTextiles have a relationship to the body that begins at birth and ends at death. As an art material, textiles can allude to the body because of the way in which we utilize fabric in our daily lives. I use textiles in my work because of the rich history it has as both a utilitarian object and artistic material. Textile labor is generally seen as women\u2019s work and so I use it to reference the feminine. I am interested in how women have used sewing circles as a way to convene and tell stories. In my work, I create loose narratives through my use of the figure and chaotic sewing style.\u201d\r\n\r\nLeeza Meksin\r\n\u201cIn addition to using a large array of fabrics, from linen and canvas to neoprene, spandex, tulle, and silk, I also use fabrics that have personal meaning to me. Items that were given to me or leftover after the passing of a person I loved. The stiffened fabrics are then formed into an architectural element such as doors and windows. In this case, a large front door, the dimensions taken from the door to my Chinati studio, refer to the ancient Egyptian use of false doors in tombs and temples which allowed the spirit to pass from our world to the next.\u201d\r\n\r\nDionis Ortiz\r\n\u201cWorking with vinyl tiles is an opportunity to express something expansive and meditative in design. Replacing tiles in my parents\u2019 apartment was an activity my father and I shared to help create a sense of opulence. We would lay new tiles on top of the current tiles and after months of accumulation, we would peel off all the tiles to lay new ones. The reveal of the tiles juxtaposed with the texture of the tile adhesives and burns is a visual reference for me when I am adding texture to patterns. The process of inlaying new tiles requires the use of a blow torch to help release a tile from another tile and minimize the strains on the hands and fingers. I employ a laborious and tedious process of layering vinyl tiles to create a fictitious environment.\u201d\r\n\r\nChrista Pratt\r\n\u201cI use materials and processes that relate to black femme adornment and visual culture, such as kanekelon braid hair and acrylic nails. The use of these materials acknowledges them as items of black culture, while also allowing the black femme body to enter the work in more abstracted ways.\u201d\r\n\r\nPadma Rajendran\r\n\u201cTextiles are essential to our lives. They protect our bodies, demarcate identity and social hierarchy, create spaces of rest, and provide emblematic comfort. It is a material we can all read regardless of \u2018art\u2019 understanding. The selected works reconstitute textile\u2019s folk art imagery and retell universal events forgotten or unseen. These works indicate how pattern, shape, and painting can come together to inform these universal wishes.\u201d\r\n\r\nRuth Rodriguez\r\n\u201cColorful fabric pattern and solid blocks of color replace skin in my paintings to allude to a sense of torn or mixed identity and the fear that my ethnicity or color will be used as a commodity. My collage materials are taken from my childhood home, consumed goods, one fabric store, and patterns I create on my iPad. Women and floral patterns subtly suggest those tired of being ornaments and decorations. My work is filled with feminine forms that are attempting to reclaim their independence from the male gaze that has dominated not just art history but modern social media outlets. I play with a woman in control and a woman during exhaustion. These women are the outcome of what happens when society subtly continues to feed the role of chef, housekeeper, laborer, manager, mother. In the struggle to get equality we are left exhausted.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiane Zhou\r\n\u201cIn \u2018Soppy,\u2019 the bath mat is a manufactured synthetic object that has sustained and repeated contact with the bottoms of the feet, imprinting feet with its patterns and absorbing the moisture and dirt that we carry around, in a mutual exchange. The plasticky smoothness eventually gets corrupted over time as it gets wet and stays in the moist chamber of a bathroom, approaching its eventual disposal. It becomes fallible and deteriorated over time as a living body would. In \u2018Rejuvenating Face Mask,\u2019 the shape of the pillow echoes that of a skincare sheet mask but is thickened like a cushy callus, departing from being a second skin on one's face, becoming an entity of its own. The kitschy luxury of the red fabric and the handmade imperfection of the pink rounded tongue shape reflect my process of trying to understand the social currents around the infamous leaked photograph depicting communist party members at an orgy embedded in the work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransmitter is a collaborative curatorial initiative based out of Brooklyn New York, focusing on programming that is multidisciplinary, international and experimental.

In his second solo show at the gallery, Mann focuses on themes of galactic and oceanic light, transparency and opacity of space, and the illusion of time. The works in the exhibition ranging from the monochromatic 12 x 12-inch square Huddle, to the 60-inch square painting, Anthem, are fully realized paintings. Each is given the focused attention of the artist to create, through the use of intense colors and luminously transparent glazes, worlds which are primitive and elemental.\r\n\r\nMann is inspired by the uncertainty of human perception when glimpsing forces of nature that are typically hidden from view. Building layers of oil, acrylic and alkyd paint, he overlaps ethereal incandescent volumes, crackling sparks and structured linear elements. The resulting images contain deep, mysterious spaces seemingly captured in moments of flux. The rich colors, inky blacks and glowing particles resemble both enormous celestial occurrences and minute energized reactions. Slightly trembling rectilinear forms hint at an underlying mathematical logic among the kinetic collisions. The compositions often imply illuminated portals, thresholds or passages, which reinforce the viewer's sense of flowing time and space. Mann indicates that transformative natural events existed prior to human witness. In Strata, for example, bright transparent blue is interlaced with a dense and reverberating foreground, evoking a sense of a deep ocean odyssey or a radiating cosmic cloud. The viewer is reminded that eternal elements such as visible light, invisible energy and streaming time combine to shape human understanding.\r\n\r\nMann\u2019s work captures a culmination and an ambiguous moment. He says, \u201cSomething is just coming into being, or on the contrary, having its moment of existence eclipsed; something is simultaneously verging on the cusp of decay and part of a moment of becoming.\u201d\r\n\r\nDavid Mann is an American artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York. His paintings have been exhibited throughout the United States and Canada, including recent solo museum exhibitions at the Flaten Art Museum, Northfield, MN, and the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC. In 2000, the artist was awarded a Pollock Krasner Foundation Award. His paintings are in several public and corporate collections including The Albright- Knox Gallery, Buffalo, NY, The Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY, and The Eli and Edyth Broad Museum at Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI. Reviews of Mann\u2019s work have been published in The New York Times, Art in America, TimeOut NY and The Brooklyn Rail, among others.\r\n\r\nMargaret Thatcher Projects is located in 539 West 23rd Street, ground floor (between 10th and 11th Avenues).

Benglis created \"Hills and Clouds\" using cast polyurethane, phosphorescent pigment, and stainless steel. Benglis, who created her first phosphorescent piece in 1971, has long been intrigued by natural phosphorescence, whether found in bioluminescent waters and phosphorescent caves or in the glow of fireflies. About this work, Benglis has said: \u201cI wanted to imply something that appears to rise instead of being connected entirely to the earth.
